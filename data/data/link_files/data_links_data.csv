0,Don't worry about sweat with our top deodorant pick,"Native Natural

Sweating. We have to do it, but that doesn’t mean we need to like the results. Sweat helps us regulate our body temperatures but it can lead to unsightly armpit stains and smells.

It’s not the sweat itself that creates the odor, it’s the bacteria that live in those tend-to-sweat places that do it.

Deodorant masks or stops that natural smell. But with so many products out there, it may be hard to find one that works for you. So we went ahead, examined what’s out there and Native Natural Deodorant in Coconut & Vanilla .

A favorite among many reviewers from websites like Amazon and Walgreens, this deodorant features a baking soda and aluminum-free formula that means anyone with sensitive underarms can still enjoy it, while also working to ensure it doesn’t leave any stains on your clothes. Made for both men and women, it’s incredibly easy to apply, and has a scent that is neither strong nor overbearing. Non-pretentious and simple, this deodorant is made to protect you from wetness and odor.

One user on Amazon tried it on her son and found that it no longer made him “smell like a used hockey jersey.” Another called it a “godsend,” while one user said that despite being a deodorant, it also helped to stop the sweat and to stay dry all day. One user commented that it kept her “smelling lovely” all day.

For this reason (along with its 4.5-star rating ), the Native Natural Deodorant in Coconut & Vanilla is our pick for the best natural deodorant.

3,"A Year in, the PPE Shortage Story Still Has No Ending","It’s been a year since Covid-19 reached American shores, but frontline workers are still struggling to find proper protection. Despite increases in production and drastic measures to expand the supply, shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) haven’t disappeared. If anything, the situation has become more confusing as emergency rules linger, counterfeits litter the market, and supplies just aren’t getting where they’re needed.

This story will start at its beginning.

Rationing

The extraordinary PPE shortages have forced healthcare administrators to make extraordinary decisions: Hospitals, needing to preserve their limited supplies, cut back on how often supplies were doled out and strictly prioritized who gots the best supplies-- OSHA even released guidelines for dividing workers into risk tiers based on patient contact and chance of encountering Covid-19. Single-use N95 masks were stretched for days or even weeks, with official CDC guidance released for mask reuse. As recently as February, 81% of nurses surveyed by National Nurses United reported still re-using masks and the AP reported that “most” hospitals still give one or fewer masks per employee per day.

A new industry quickly sprouted around adapting masks policies for repeated use. Peter Tsai, the inventor of the N95 mask, came out of retirement to help the N95DECON project develop ways to sanitize and reuse the masks.

As of April 2020, ECRI data showed that 48% of surveyed hospitals were already using at least one method to sanitize masks for further use.

Setting the stage

When the pandemic began, the PPE situation in America was already precarious. The national stockpile had been depleted during the H1N1 crisis and not replaced, while American hospitals and other institutions became overly reliant on foreign imports. China, hammered by the pandemic months before it spread to the rest of the world, had taken two big actions: soliciting aid from other countries and clamping down on its own exports -- leaving few available for America to import.

American production capacity was too weak to pick up the slack. Previously burned by unstable demand, manufacturers like Prestige Ameritech simply weren’t prepared for the dire need faced by the pandemic-hit healthcare system.

An industry resurgence

The desperate need for PPE led to a resurgence in American production. Then-President Trump used the WW2-era Defense Production Act to boost PPE manufacturing, a move that the Biden administration is poised to continue. Many US firms in other industries pivoted to produce a variety of needed goods, from gowns to hand sanitizer.

The fallout

Despite production stabilizing, hospitals are still rationing to ensure a consistent supply of masks and to keep costs down. Scientists and frontline workers are expressing concern about the supply and the current CDC guidelines and hospital policies regarding who needs higher-tier protective gear.

To make matters worse, there’s also a need to question whether the PPEs that are available can be trusted.

A flood of fakes

A rare Umbrella EUA has allowed foreign masks Chinese KN95s to be used here in the US, but that’s opened the door for counterfeiters and lesser options. ECRI, an organization dedicated to monitoring healthcare safety standards, found that up to 70% of tested KN95 masks did not meet minimum safety standards for use in a healthcare environment. Some imported masks arrived alongside falsified National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) approval paperwork, fake registry numbers, or information copied from other products.

Government agencies are working together to weed out the fakes, with over 11 million seized in recent weeks. Healthcare providers have to consult guides like this one from the FDA to identify legitimate manufacturers and this one from the CDC try to filter out the fakes. Nonetheless, shipments of fakes are still making their way to hospitals now.

Government action is helping to keep counterfeits out of workers’ hands, but in other areas, it may be causing problems.

The big disconnect

It took time, but American manufacturers did respond to the challenge. Now, they’re having trouble selling them.

Despite healthcare workers not having enough PPE and the US Strategic National Stockpile not yet reaching desired levels, an export ban has been modified to allow as many as 5 million masks to leave the country each month.

Why?

Kaiser Health News obtained a FEMA memo regarding this change, which was sent less than two hours before Joe Biden’s inauguration. According to KHN, the memo cites manufacturer Prestige Ameritech’s difficulties finding buyers for its high-end respirators and says that lifting this ban will allow American companies to continue their pandemic-accelerated pace of manufacturing.

Advocacy groups like Get Us PPE told KHN it believes current CDC guidelines, in particular the same pandemic-era emergency guidelines that allow reuse and waive requirements like fit testing, permit hospitals and other employers to order fewer PPE and restrict who gets protection. High-end respirators also aren’t yet recommended outside healthcare settings, even for people in high-traffic enclosed environments like public transit.

The domestic market is a mess. Smaller clinics and offices don’t know where to get verified PPE, while big storefronts like Amazon and Facebook are keeping manufacturers from selling to the public. There’s also a problem of cost, with more expensive American products reportedly struggling against the restored flow of cheaper imports.

The outlook

Keeping our healthcare workers safe is important, and the influx of fake products poses a real risk. With emergency guidelines still in place and the political field in a state of flux, it’s hard to see exactly where the situation will go. The message from workers on the front lines is clear, though: get more N95s onto faces, and make it fast.

4,Can the mRNA vaccines change DNA?,"Coronaviruses range from the common cold to more severe infections such as SARS (SARS-CoV) and MERS (MERS-CoV) and the current Covid-19 (SARS-CoV-2). As yet there is no FDA-approved vaccine to prevent coronavirus infections. These both have FDA emergency use authorization.

Two of the Covid-19 vaccines available in the US use messenger RNA technology to prevent or reduce the symptoms of Covid-19 infection. This mRNA vaccine technology is new; the consequences of altered DNA, if any, are unknown. However, others, including the CDC said that the virus would not interact with DNA.

Other scientists believe that mRNA vaccines can enter and permanently alter DNA. Like DNA vaccines, RNA vaccines use part of the genetic code of the virus to get the immune system to respond.

An article currently in preprint (not yet peer reviewed) discusses a lab study in which some pieces of Covid-19 RNA were converted to DNA and then integrated into human chromosomes.

Medical Daily talked to lead author Rudolf Jaenisch, MD. A professor of Biology at MIT, Dr. Jaenisch, performed the first experiment proving that genetic defects could be corrected in rodents. Currently he is working on Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, autism and cancer in humans. He has won numerous awards for his work, including the Wolf Prize in Medicine.

MD: Does your recent study indicate that the Covid-19 mRNA vaccines can damage DNA in humans?

Dr. Jaenisch: Not really evidence of damage. The mRNA can integrate into the DNA and possibly be expressed but there is no direct evidence of that.

MD: If the mRNA vaccines can integrate into human DNA what could this mean for the future?

Dr. Jaenisch: It will be breakthrough technology. It will change the way diseases are treated.

MD: How will mRNA or DNA vaccines change treatments?

Dr. Jaenisch: These mRNA Covid-19 vaccines are the first to show safety and efficacy of this type of therapy. If there is sufficient evidence that this technology is safe and effective then this has huge potential for future therapies for treating many diseases.

The Jaenisch lab’s work might also explain why patients who have recovered from Covid-19 still test positive for the disease, even months later, according to an ABC news report. If the virus did modify these patients’ DNA, then its genetic information could still be active. The Jaenisch lab found that the virus used an enzyme called LINE-1 to get back into the cell to replicate. LINE-1 is readily available in the human genome.

Regarding whether mRNA vaccines could change DNA, Dr. Jaenisch thinks it might be a good thing. He also thinks this new technology will lead the way to breakthrough treatments for many diseases that affect people. Since Dr. Jaenisch has been studying DNA in cancer and neurological diseases for decades, what he thinks is likely more than most of us know.

5,Bill to Prevent Tip-Over Deaths Reintroduced,"In January 2021, the Consumer Protection Safety Commission* released a report on the number of accidents involving a piece of furniture or a television falling on someone. Of the 571 fatalities, 469 were children under 18 years. The report covered the years between 2000 through 2019.

In January 2018,** the CPSC released a similar report, which covered the years 2000 through 2017. That period had 542 reported fatalities, of which 450 involved children younger than 14. Nineteen more youngsters lost their lives between the two reporting periods because a tv or a piece of furniture were not anchored. In both studies, the vast majority of deaths involved a television.

USCPSC/Flickr CC BY 2.0

Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky, Democrat of Illinois, and fellow sponsor Senator Robert Casey of Pennsylvania, want to make furniture safer with the Stop Tip-Overs of Unstable, Risky Dressers of Youth Act of 2021 (STURDY act). The proposed legislation, first introduced in 2019 and not considered, was reintroduced by Schakowsky and Casey in February 2021. So far, the bill has 15 co-sponsors in the Senate, including Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, and Corey Booker of New Jersey.

According to Consumer Reports, current furniture stability standards are voluntary. Manufacturers are not required to conduct safety testing before putting furniture on the market.

If it becomes law, the legislation would direct the CPSC to develop and enforce mandatory stability standards for clothing units, such as chests, dressers, and bureaus. The legislation is supported by several consumer groups including Parents Against Tip-Overs and the American Academy of Pediatrics.

6,The Top Pick For Your Mouth: Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Comfort Plus Dental Floss,"Oral-B

No doubt, brushing your teeth morning and night takes a lead role on the oral health stage, but flossing should be given its share of the limelight. While brushing cleans the surface of your teeth, dental floss removes the plaque, food, and other build-up from between your teeth that otherwise could cause long-term damage.

But which floss to choose? After reviewing top websites and user reviews, we are good with recommending the Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Comfort Plus Dental Floss .

Pro-Health Plus is shred-resistant and mint-flavored. Its manufacturer says Pro-Health floss slides more easily into tight spots between teeth than other brands.

Buyers agree. The Glide Pro-Health Comfort Plus currently has over 9,000 positive reviews on Amazon, and holds a perfect rating of 5 stars. This floss is gentle on gums but strong enough to do its job.

We recommend Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Comfort Plus Dental Floss as the best dental floss out there.

7,CDC: Finger on J&J Pause Button Will Be Lifted in Days,"The pause on the Johnson & Johnson Covid 19 vaccine should last days, not weeks, according to CDC and FDA officials.

In a 37-minute online briefing Tuesday, government health officials said pausing administering the J&J vaccine will give scientists time to investigate what appears to be an autoimmune response that leads to cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, an extremely rare, severe stroke-like reaction.

With more than 6 million doses of the J&J vaccine administered so far, there are six known cases of CVST. All occurred in women 18 to 48 years of age. One woman has died and another is in critical condition.

CVST is rare, affecting five people in 1 million, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine. However, the J&J cases are even more rare because they are accompanied by a low platelet count, according to Peter Marks, MD, PhD, a panel member and director of the FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.

“Right now these events appear to be extremely rare,” Dr. Marks said. “That said, Covid-19 vaccine safety is a top priority for the federal government and we take all events following vaccination very seriously.”

In the reported cases, the adverse reaction occurred 6 to 13 days after receiving the J&J vaccine. Recognizing that the pause would worry people who have received it, Anne Schuchat, MD, a panel member and the CDC’s principal deputy director, tried to assuage fears.

“For people who got the vaccine more than a month ago, the risk to them is very low at this time,” said Dr. Schuchat. “For people who recently got the vaccine in the last couple of weeks, they should be aware to look for any symptoms.”

Those symptoms include severe headache, abdominal pain, leg pain, or shortness of breath. Anyone experiencing any one of those symptoms should immediately contact their doctor. Dr. Schuchat added that the CDC has not had any reports of low platelet counts in the more than 190 million people who received either the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccines. Both of those vaccines use new mRNA technology. The J&J vaccine uses an adenovirus.

The CDC’s independent Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices was expected to begin reviewing the J&J case data Wednesday to consider the next step. In the meantime, officials will alert doctors about the symptoms and how to treat patients who are affected.

“We’re committed to follow the science and to ensure transparency and provide regular updates,” Dr. Schuchat said. “We are going to tell you what we know when we know it and what you can do to protect yourself. Our intention is to update you in the days ahead.”

While no one is sure about what causes the rare reaction, a leading theory, said Dr. Marks, is that an immune response activates platelets which leads to clotting and the stroke-like reaction. Similar cases of blood clotting have been reported in Europe with the AstraZeneca vaccine. In those cases blood clots formed in the gastrointestinal system.

8,"The Fitness Industry, Already Changed, Could Morph Even More","As more people get vaccinated, the prospect of life returning to something akin to normal is growing. But also growing is the number of new Covid 19 cases and the spread of its variants.

Consequently, people are still cautious about wearing a mask, who they see, and where they go. Being outdoors is clearly much safer than gathering indoors. And that’s not good news for gyms. But the road to fitness doesn’t necessarily require a gym.

The fact is, the pandemic has changed the way Americans are staying fit. Two industry veterans detail how the industry and modern technology brought the gym/trainer experience into the American living room.

The changing business

When the Covid-19 pandemic hit it shook the fitness industry. Like so many businesses, gyms were closed and even outdoor exercise groups were frowned upon. Exercise, like everything else, came home..

Home workouts aren’t new. Infomercials for products ranging from makeshift pull-up bars to multi-exercise gym machines to video lessons have played on late-night television for decades. The age of the iPad, built around easy connectivity, transformed fitness. And then came the pandemic.

“Almost overnight, everyone was looking for a solution that had nothing to do with the physical gym itself,” said Vincent Miceli, owner of The Body Blueprint gym in Westchester, New York and a new AI-powered accountability platform called Verb. “Everyone was scrambling [to find ways] to maintain memberships and add value. Six months of zero revenue [has] put almost all of us out of business.”

The answer: bring fitness training home.

Live training

The same video-streaming technology used for office meetings and school could be used to live-stream exercise classes into living rooms. Nick Hounslow, personal trainer turned cofounder and owner of online fitness community 1WRKOUT, appreciated how the pandemic would slash his gym-based business, so he pivoted his classes online. He realized that much of what trainers do in person, they could do over video.

“Live trainers offer accountability and a call to action from having been paid money,” said Hounslow. “There’s less of a novelty. You get motivation and investment.”

But one thing they can’t reduce is risk of injury by correcting a position or technique.

While Miceli isn’t a big fan of live video classes, he does see the benefits. For starters, the client doesn’t have to come to the gym.

“It removes having to go out,” he said. “It removes having to worry about babysitters. It removes feeling inadequate around a group of people. It removes any ego you may or may not have. It allows people to work within their own safety both with intensity, weight and comfort level.”

Recorded lessons

Perhaps the simplest form of home exercise is a recorded lesson. Whether printed in a book, a video tape of yore, a digital disc, or streaming online, entire lessons and workout routines can be brought into the user’s home, on his or her schedule.

If these options don’t appeal, there are always YouTube playlists or an interactive app.

Pre-recorded videos let gyms offer different exercises and workout programs. Coaches don’t need to be available to teach on demand, and members can work out when they want. Users can seek out of certain exercises and coaches can recommend workouts without worrying about schedules.

For Miceli, building a service is the key to making video work.

A new package

Verb AI, Miceli’s new platform, uses text-messaging combined with digital video, artificial intelligence technology, and real coaches. AI removes some of the guesswork by sending automated messages to gather information.

Once received, the program analyzes the information sent back.

At this point a human enters the picture. A coach studies the information and makes recommendations. To create a holistic view of a client’s wellness, coaches use answers from an AI-generated survey to evaluate factors such as sleep, stress, food, and hydration as well as physical activity.

“It [Verb] positioned us in a really interesting place,” Miceli said. “The majority of the world in the in-home space are in the hardware game or the app game. We decided to launch with what would be considered this low-tech solution.”

Relying on text messages to communicate with clients and keeping the complicated stuff behind the scenes allows almost anyone to use Verb AI. Plus, by expanding beyond the gym’s wall, the fitness experience can be all day or even all week.

“Verb just becomes part of the day, keeping people engaged through habit,” Miceli said. “Users will become accustomed to thinking more about their choices every day, even the traditional `off day’ from the gym.”

Verb had been in development when the pandemic hit. Within six months, growth was explosive, going from 80 users and a single coach, to 12,000 and 300 coaches. More than half of users have remained long-term.

Connections

At the heart of the 21st century concepts on home fitness is human connection. Both men agree that the key to keeping at-home fitness going is through engaging their clients and encouraging a sense of responsibility.

“[The program] takes you, as a user, five seconds to answer one of our questions,” Miceli said. For the coach, redirecting the user’s attention might take a couple of minutes because the coach has quickly received the “nuts and bolts.” Before, it would have taken the coach an hour to two hours a day of interaction. “It just was so simple, from the ease of use standpoint.”

With 1WRKOUT, the entire class shares a bond, much like they would in a gym or yoga studio.

”Groups in person and online create a feeling of community,” Hounslow said. “It's a very personal choice. Group training offers accountability while still affordable and allows you to be part of something bigger.”

Being in a group doesn’t mean you don’t get personal attention. “You still get some 1 on 1 attention during our classes,” Hounslow said.

The internet also opens up a wider world -- classes aren’t limited to people in the immediate area. “Talking to people in different places around the globe is cool, helps with the feeling of intense isolation,” Hounslow said.

Who’s it for?

Hounslow and Miceli said their clients are all different ages.

“Nineteen to 35 year olds are really attracted to this,” Miceli said. But “some of my longest standing clients are above 50. Both male and female.”

Hounslow agreed, noting that 1WRKOUT has classes filled with people from multiple generations. Some “from the same family and even better, families that haven't been able to see each other due to Covid can make workout dates and join classes together.”

And even though it’s designed for humans, furry friends have occasionally joined, too. “It's amazing! Pets also constantly come in,” Hounslow chuckled. “It's very funny!”

Ultimately, for Miceli, it’s less about demographics and more about goals, which should be re-evaluated monthly. “Really, the user we look for, and that speaks to the platform the most, is any person that just wants to understand what's working or not working for them. And that could actually be any person.”

A Lasting change

The pandemic isn’t finished changing the fitness industry.

“People realize that they can do so much at home so they may end up doing at-home some days and go to the gym others,” Hounslow said. Resting more, not dealing with traffic.”

Miceli agreed, and discussed the future.

“There’s no scenario where what’s going on in technology doesn’t reshape the fitness industry,” he said. “What I think is going to happen is that moving forward the fitness industry is actually going to be a combination of both. I don’t think video or in-home completely wins.

“People are going to look to this hybrid combination where they know they can get the fitness they need at home via video or via some interactive version of fitness and then have that same social atmosphere, the friends they saw at the gym, still go on a few days a week.”

9,"Vape Products, Distribution, Have Got the FDA’s Attention","It’s a tough time to be a vaper. New restrictions at the federal and state levels will make it harder for them to buy and sell vaping products -- both with and without nicotine, as the FDA’s enforcement efforts continue to crack down on illegal vape distributors.

Shipping ain’t easy

Late in 2020, Congress passed new restrictions on how USPS can ship tobacco products; the expanded law now includes vaping products. The Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking (PACT) Act, signed into law in 2009, essentially said the US Postal Office could not deliver any tobacco products directly to the consumer.

In the 2020 bill, Congress amended the act, expanding the law to include any “electronic nicotine delivery system,” defined as “any electronic device that, through an aerosolized solution, delivers nicotine, flavor, or any other substance to the user inhaling from the device.” FDA-approved therapeutics and cessation tools are exempted so long as they are only marketed for cessation.

Private shipping firms FedEx and UPS have since adopted similar restrictions. FedEx will not accept any shipments of tobacco-related products. This even applies to shops, regardless of license or authorization.

UPS instituted new policies on April 5, banning delivery of tobacco-related products. Its listed policy is more specific than FedEx’s, stipulating the vaping products do not need to contain tobacco or nicotine to be affected by the ban. It also specifies that it will neither import nor export such products.

Violating the law carries civil and criminal penalties. The law was amended in 2010, for among other reasons, because tobacco suppliers and customers were using the internet for their transactions, bypassing federal laws for record-keeping and tax collecting. The US e-cigarette and vape market was valued at $6.09 billion last year.

FDA actions continue

The transition from the Trump to the Biden administration hasn’t slowed down ongoing FDA crackdowns on vape shops and e-cigarette distributors. So far this year, dozens of vape manufacturers and distributors have received warning letters from the Center for Tobacco Products. Many of the firms which received letters are manufacturers registered with the FDA, some with thousands of other products that have met the requirements.

The FDA regulates tobacco products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Tobacco Control Act of 2009. It defines tobacco products as “any product made or derived from tobacco and intended for human consumption, including any component, part, or accessory of a tobacco product.” That means both vaping devices and liquids are classified as tobacco products. The warnings are primarily for adding an unknown ingredient and not representing what the product truthfully contains or can do. In FDA parlance: adulterated and misbranded.

In the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, products are “adulterated” because they have not been granted FDA authorization for production and sale, and “misbranded” because they do not carry a mandatory notice with manufacturing and content information.

A hodgepodge of local rules

At the state and local levels, change is also in motion-- in multiple directions. Prospective

vapers and distributors will have to keep a close eye on new developments.

According to local reports, Florida is moving to raise the smoking and vaping age to 21 and to regulate vaping products separately from combustibles. Tennessee is also raising the age to 21, while Suffolk County, New York considers an even bigger increase to 25.

Flavor bans are under consideration in Indiana and as part of a larger list of restrictions in Connecticut, while an indoor vaping ban recently passed in Nebraska. South Carolina is introducing legislation to take regulatory power away from municipalities and to concentrate it at the state level.

The take home

The FDA is not offering anything new in terms of vaping safety information, but its regulations do underscore something every consumer should remember: Be careful about the sources you trust, and take the time to make sure you know what you’re buying. Especially in evolving markets, it’s important to pay heed to those gray areas.

10,PSA: Women's Health Alert on J&J Vaccine,"Following 6 cases of dangerous blood clots in women who received the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine, the FDA has called for a temporary halt and the CDC is convening the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) to investigate. The FDA has issued a health warning to women regarding the vaccine, referencing a joint CDC/FDA statement that we have included in full below:



Joint CDC and FDA Statement on Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 Vaccine The following statement is attributed to Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research and Dr. Anne Schuchat, Principal Deputy Director of the CDC

As of April 12, more than 6.8 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) vaccine have been administered in the U.S. CDC and FDA are reviewing data involving six reported U.S. cases of a rare and severe type of blood clot in individuals after receiving the J&J vaccine. In these cases, a type of blood clot called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) was seen in combination with low levels of blood platelets (thrombocytopenia). All six cases occurred among women between the ages of 18 and 48, and symptoms occurred 6 to 13 days after vaccination. Treatment of this specific type of blood clot is different from the treatment that might typically be administered. Usually, an anticoagulant drug called heparin is used to treat blood clots. In this setting, administration of heparin may be dangerous, and alternative treatments need to be given.

CDC will convene a meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) on Wednesday to further review these cases and assess their potential significance. FDA will review that analysis as it also investigates these cases. Until that process is complete, we are recommending a pause in the use of this vaccine out of an abundance of caution. This is important, in part, to ensure that the health care provider community is aware of the potential for these adverse events and can plan for proper recognition and management due to the unique treatment required with this type of blood clot.

Right now, these adverse events appear to be extremely rare. COVID-19 vaccine safety is a top priority for the federal government, and we take all reports of health problems following COVID-19 vaccination very seriously. People who have received the J&J vaccine who develop severe headache, abdominal pain, leg pain, or shortness of breath within three weeks after vaccination should contact their health care provider. Health care providers are asked to report adverse events to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System at https://vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html.

12,Why We’re Sleepless in America,"Thanks to Amerisleep, we know why Tom Hanks’ character was “Sleepless in Seattle” - he had exploding head syndrome.

Saying huh? Read on.

Using Google’s Keyword Planner, Amerisleep, a memory-foam mattress maker, analyzed four years of sleep-related queries in Google to learn what makes Americans toss and turn at night. For instance, Californians worry about sleep paralysis, while New Yorkers want to tune out snoring. Makes sense if you are nervous about explosive wildfires or living in high-rises with thin-silk walls.

And it makes sense that Kansans are nervous about nightmares (“I’ll get you my pretty, and your little dog too”). So are people in Nevada; wonder how many out-of-towners Googled nightmares while visiting Las Vegas?

In New England, there are a whole lot of people experiencing night sweats -- can’t be all menopause- or Tom Brady-related -- save for the good folk in Connecticut. They looked up hypoxia, which is a scary condition in which the body’s tissues aren’t getting enough oxygen.

But what’s with the cowboys in Wyoming carking over breathing while sleeping? As for people experiencing exploding head syndrome’s loud, unreal noises, maybe they should cut back on the caffeine.

And heaven knows what’s going on in Montana; the most looked-up term by the good people there was halitosis, or morning breath.

As for the Lone Star state, Texans want to know what their dreams mean. Don’t we all.

14,"Anxious about going out into the world? You’re not alone, but there’s help","Claudia Finkelstein, Michigan State University

It’s the moment we thought we were all waiting for…or is it?

We were cautiously optimistic about the end of the pandemic in view of increasing vaccine availability and decreasing case numbers after the peak in January.

Then, whether due to variants, pandemic fatigue or both, cases and case positivity began to increase again – throwing into question whether the end was as near as we thought. This is merely one of the most recent of the many reversals.

I am a physician and associate professor of medicine at Michigan State University’s College of Human Medicine. In my role as the director of wellness, resiliency and vulnerable populations, I speak with staff and faculty members who may need a sympathetic ear or may be struggling.

Amid the happiness and relief that people are feeling, I also see confusion and some fear. Some people are wary of going out again, and others are eager to throw a party. Some learned that they like being alone and do not want to stop nesting. I think this is all normal from a year of what I call the zigzag pandemic.

Change after change

Awareness of the novel coronavirus for most of us rose between January – when the first cases in China were reported – and March 11, 2020, when the World Health Organization officially declared a pandemic. Since the declaration, daily uncertainty and contradictory information has been the norm.

First, no masks were needed. Then you had to wear a mask. Hydroxychloroquine looked promising and got emergency use authorization, but that was revoked fairly quickly and officials said not only was there no benefit but there was some potential harm.

We were transiently afraid of groceries, packages and surfaces. Then data emerged that surfaces were not as dangerous as previously thought.

In the absence of a coordinated national policy, states began to fend for themselves, creating their own policies regarding shutdowns and masks.

Even now, there is state-by-state variability in which businesses may be open and at what capacity and whether masks are required, suggested or neither.

Both inevitable and avoidable factors played into the back-and-forth. Part of the whiplash is due to the “novel” part of the novel coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2. This virus is new and many of its characteristics unknown, leading to policy revisions becoming necessary as more becomes known.

Part of the zigzag is due to the nature of clinical trials and the nature of the way scientific knowledge emerges. Learning about a new pathogen requires time and the willingness to challenge initial assumptions. Part is due to the lack of a reliable source of information trusted to act in our collective best interests and a lack of preparedness.

Given the reversals behind us and uncertainty ahead, we need to examine both individual and societal responses moving forward.

Different experiences

There is no question that all of our lives have changed. However, the ways in which they have changed has varied widely. The variation depends on our jobs – think of the differences for grocery store, tech and health care workers – our living situations, our underlying physical and mental health, our financial status and our personalities, just to begin with.

For example, some introverts have been fortunate enough to work remotely in comfortable clothes with broadband internet and no children to educate, while their extroverted colleagues have longed for more social connection. Their colleagues with young children and jobs that could not be done remotely have been scrambling. Many have hit the wall and find themselves adrift and unmotivated, while others have seemingly thrived doing long-postponed projects.

Nearly everyone has been affected in some way. A recent systematic review

concluded that the pandemic is associated with highly significant levels of psychological distress, particularly in certain higher-risk groups.

As individuals, what can help us get through this?

What we can do for ourselves

First, we can begin by making a fearless assessment of our current reality – the state of now. Sometimes making an actual list of our needs and assets can help us to prioritize next steps. Steps may be visiting a community health center, a virtual therapist, a job fair or even something as simple as carrying a printable wallet card with stress reduction tips.

What might work for you might not work for your spouse, partner or best friend. We need to be doing whatever is known to foster resilience in ourselves and our family members.

This includes making human connections, moving our bodies and learning to regulate our emotions. Looking back at how we handled past difficulties may help us. Mental health concerns have become more common, and evidence on overall impact of the pandemic on mental health is still being collected.

There has been increased public awareness about these issues, and telehealth has eased access for some seeking help. Our society – individuals as well as institutions – needs to continue to work to make it acceptable for people to get mental health care without worrying about stigma.

Deciding which of your normal activities you wish to resume and which to let go of helps you to prepare for the future. So does noting which new activities you’d like to hold on to. These lists potentially include attending family or sporting events, traveling, going to the gym or live worship. You may choose to continue to cook at home or work from home if you have the choice. Of course, all of these choices should be made in accordance with CDC guidelines.

And then there are things we may not want to do. That can include behaviors we learned about during the pandemic that don’t make us feel good or serve us well. That may include watching too much news, drinking too much alcohol and not getting enough sleep. And yes, maybe there are some relationships that need changing or reworking.

Then, we need to to think about what we can do on a level larger than the individual.

Societal and governmental changes

For many people, it feels futile to address individual resilience without addressing what feels like a rigged system.

The pandemic hit at a particularly politically polarized time and a particularly unprepared time. This was unfortunate, because fighting a common adversary – such as polio or a world war – can unite a population.

In contrast, the coronavirus was subject to multiple conflicting interpretations and even doubt about its severity. Rather than rallying together against the virus, our adherence to mandates became a surrogate for our political beliefs.

Now that longstanding inequities have been highlighted by differential infection, hospitalization and mortality rates by race, political and public health officials can begin a careful analysis of the gaps in health care coverage by race.

While examining how to effectively address longstanding disparities is crucial, so is being prepared for the next pandemic. A coordinated nonpartisan, science-based health infrastructure prepared to rapidly roll out emergency responses as well as consistent clear messaging would be vital. However, without a population willing to consider collective good ahead of individual freedom, we run the risk of repeating history.

15,New EU Vaccine Probe Deepens Europe's Covid Woes,"Europe's stuttering vaccine rollout faced multiple hurdles on Friday as EU regulators said they were reviewing side effects of the Johnson & Johnson shot and France further limited its use of the AstraZeneca jab.

The US drugs regulator said it had not found a ""causal"" link between the J&J vaccine and blood clots, but that its probe was continuing after ""a few individuals"" suffered complications.

Much of the world is still in the clutches of the pandemic that has killed 2.9 million people, from Brazil, where the virus is killing more than 4,000 people a day, to Japan where the government has tightened restrictions once again.

In India, the worst-hit state of Maharashtra is running out of vaccines as the health system buckles under the weight of the contagion. Home to megacity Mumbai, Maharashtra has been placed under a curfew and weekend lockdowns.

And across Europe populations are facing some of the world's toughest anti-virus measures, yet the epidemic refuses to be curbed.

All of France is subjected to restrictions of some form, and the country has so far doled out jabs to more than 10 million people.

But it has repeatedly changed the rules on AstraZeneca's vaccine, first over doubts about its efficacy, then over fears that it could be linked to blood clots.

On Friday it did so again, with Health Minister Olivier Veran saying citizens under 55 who had been given a first shot with AstraZeneca would be given a different vaccine for their second dose.

But shortly after he spoke, the World Health Organization said there was ""no adequate data"" to support switching Covid-19 vaccines between doses.

As Europe continues to reel from constant rows over AstraZeneca's jab, the EU's medicine regulator announced it would be probing a second jab over bloodclot concerns.

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said four ""serious cases"" of unusual blood clots had been reported -- one of them fatal -- with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which uses similar technology to the AstraZeneca one.

The US Food and Drug Administration said it had found no ""causal"" link yet between the jab and clots.

But it noted ""a few individuals"" in the country had clots and low levels of platelets in the blood after receiving the vaccine, and its investigation was continuing.

""Both conditions can have many different causes,"" the agency said.

Johnson & Johnson released a statement saying the company was aware that ""thromboembolic events... have been reported with all Covid-19 vaccines"".

But the statement added: ""At present, no clear causal relationship has been established between these rare events and the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine,"" referring to J&J's European subsidiary.

Both jabs are approved for use in the European Union but the J&J vaccine has not yet been rolled out, and various EU countries have stopped or limited the use of AstraZeneca.

Supply problem are also hampering vaccine rollouts.

India, which is one of the world's leading manufacturers of vaccines, is suffering its own problems with jabs in Maharashtra, home to more than 100 million people and the economic hub Mumbai.

""Most hospitals in Mumbai will exhaust their supplies by the end of the day,"" Mangala Gomare, who oversees the city's vaccination programme, told AFP Friday.

In the United States, deliveries of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine are set to drop off sharply next week, US health authorities warned Friday.

Meanwhile Pfizer-BioNTech asked for authorisation to use their Covid-19 vaccine on 12-15 year olds in the US.

The companies said in a statement that they plan to make similar requests of other regulatory authorities worldwide in coming days.

In Europe, an AstraZeneca spokesman said half of its vaccine shipments to the EU will be delayed this week.

Swedish climate campaigner Greta Thunberg said Friday she would skip a forthcoming climate meeting in Britain because countries were unable to participate on even terms.

""With the extremely inequitable vaccine distribution I will not attend the COP26 conference if the development continues as it is now,"" Thunberg told AFP.

Illustrating her point, Britain has so far given at least one jab to more than 31 million people, almost half of its population, compared with poorer countries like Mexico, which has administered fewer than 10 million jabs to only seven percent of its people.

Germany's central government has tried hard to defeat the virus through restrictions on movement and commerce, but several states have torpedoed the strategy by refusing to go along with the proposals.

Now Berlin is changing the rules to gather more centralised power.

The proposed adjustments are likely to usher in night-time curfews and some school closures in especially hard-hit areas.

Japan has also tightened measures in the capital Tokyo and other areas, mostly calling for bars to close early.

On the other hand, Italy is set to end lockdown measures from next week for Lombardy, the epicentre of its coronavirus pandemic, and several other regions with improving contagion statistics.

And in badly hit Brazil, the Senate said it will open an inquiry into the government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, as President Jair Bolsonaro continues to resist lockdown measures even with Covid-19 deaths at new records.

Yet Rio de Janeiro on Friday was reversing restrictions in place for two weeks, reopening restaurants and bars, though the city's famed beaches remained closed.",www.medicaldaily.com
16,Pfizer Seeks Covid Vaccine Authorization For 12-15 Year Olds In US,"Pfizer-BioNTech asked for authorization Friday to use their Covid-19 vaccine on 12 to 15-year-olds in the United States, which could mark a crucial next step toward achieving herd immunity.

The mass vaccination of teenagers would also relieve an enormous strain on parents who are juggling the demands of homeschooling their children while keeping up with jobs.

The companies said in a statement that they plan to make similar requests of other regulatory authorities worldwide in coming days.

Their request to the US Food and Drug Administration comes after Phase 3 clinical trials of the Pfizer vaccine in 12 to 15-year-olds showed it was 100 percent effective in warding off the disease, according to the companies.

In late March they published the results of trials carried out with 2,260 adolescents in the US whom the companies said showed ""robust antibody responses.""

The vaccine was ""well tolerated with side effects generally consistent with those observed in participants 16 to 25 years of age,"" the companies said Friday.

For now the vaccine has emergency authorization for use in people aged 16 and over.

Children are less likely to develop severe Covid so vaccinating them has been less of a priority than getting older people inoculated.

But they do make up a large part of the community that will need to be inoculated in order to achieve herd immunity, when the proportion of people with antibodies largely prevents the spread of the virus.

Experts do not know precisely what percentage of the population needs to be vaccinated to get to that point, but one of the leading US immunologists, Anthony Fauci, has put it anywhere between 70 and 85 percent.

In February, he said that US children aged 12 or under could very likely be vaccinated by the start of 2022.

The BioNTech/Pfizer shot is based on new mRNA technology and was the first Covid-19 vaccine to be approved in the West late last year.

In March, the US biotech company Moderna said it had started trials on children aged between six months and 11 years. Johnson & Johnson, whose vaccine was the third approved for US use, has also started trials on the 12 to 17 age group.",www.medicaldaily.com
17,"They Tested Negative for Covid. Still, They Have Long Covid Symptoms.","Kristin Novotny once led an active life, with regular CrossFit workouts and football in the front yard with her children — plus a job managing the kitchen at a middle school. Now, the 33-year-old mother of two from De Pere, Wisconsin, has to rest after any activity, even showering. Conversations leave her short of breath.

Long after their initial coronavirus infections, patients with a malady known as “long covid” continue to struggle with varied symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath, gastrointestinal problems, muscle and joint pain, and neurological issues. Novotny has been contending with these and more, despite testing negative for covid-19 seven months ago.

Experts don’t yet know what causes long covid or why some people have persistent symptoms while others recover in weeks or even days. They also don’t know just how long the condition — referred to formally by scientists as Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection, or PASC — lasts.

But the people who didn’t test positive for covid — due either to a lack of access to testing or a false-negative result — face difficulty getting treatment and disability benefits. Their cases are not always included in studies of long covid despite their lingering symptoms. And, sometimes as aggravating, many find that family, friends or even doctors have doubts they contracted covid at all.

Novotny, who first became ill in August, initially returned to work at the beginning of the school year, but her symptoms snowballed and, one day months later, she couldn’t catch her breath at work. She went home and hasn’t been well enough to return.

“It is sad and frustrating being unable to work or play with my kids,” Novotny said via email, adding that it’s devastating to see how worried her family is about her. “My 9-year-old is afraid that if I’m left alone, I will have a medical emergency and no one will be here to help.”

Data about the frequency of false-negative diagnostic covid tests is extremely limited. A study at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and Bloomberg School of Public Health, which focused on the time between exposure and testing, found a median false-negative rate of 20% three days after symptoms start. A small study in China conducted early in the pandemic found a high rate of negative tests even among patients sick enough to be hospitalized. And given the dearth of long-hauler research, patients dealing with lingering covid symptoms have organized to study themselves.

The haphazard protocols for testing people in the United States, the delays and difficulties accessing tests and the poor quality of many of the tests left many people without proof they were infected with the virus that causes covid-19.

“It’s great if someone can get a positive test, but many people who have covid simply will never have one, for a variety of different reasons,” said Natalie Lambert, an associate research professor at the Indiana University School of Medicine and director of research for the online covid support group Survivor Corps.

Lambert’s work with computational analytics has found that long haulers face such a wide variety of symptoms that no single symptom is a good screening tool for covid. “If PCR tests are not always accurate or available at the right time and it’s not always easy to diagnose based on someone’s initial symptoms, we really need to have a more flexible, expansive way of diagnosing for covid based on clinical presentations,” she said.

Dr. Bobbi Pritt, chair of the division of clinical microbiology at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, said four factors affect the accuracy of a diagnostic test: when the patient’s sample is collected, what part of the body it comes from, the technique of the person collecting the sample and the test type.

“But if one of those four things isn’t correct,” said Pritt, “you could still have a false-negative result.”

Timing is one of the most nebulous elements in accurately detecting SARS-CoV-2. The body doesn’t become symptomatic immediately after exposure. It takes time for the virus to multiply and this incubation period tends to last four or five days before symptoms start for most people. “But we’ve known that it can be as many as 14 days,” Pritt said.

Testing during that incubation period — however long it may be — means there may not be enough detectable virus yet.

“Early on after infection, you may not see it because the person doesn’t have enough virus around for you to find,” said Dr. Yuka Manabe, an infectious-disease expert and a professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.

Novotny woke up with symptoms on Aug. 14 and got a covid test later that day. Three days later — the same day her test result came back negative — she went to the hospital because of severe shortness of breath and chest pressure.

“The hospital chose not to test me due to test shortages and told me to presume positive,” Novotny wrote, adding that hospital staffers told her she likely tested too early and received a false negative.

As the virus leaves the body, it becomes undetectable, but patients may still have symptoms because their immune responses kicked in. At that point, “you’re seeing more of an inflammatory phase of illness,” Manabe said.

An autoimmune response, in which the body’s defense system attacks its own healthy tissue, may be behind persistent covid symptoms in many patients, though small amounts of virus hiding in organs is another explanation.

Andréa Ceresa is nearing a year of long covid and has an extensive list of symptoms, topped by gastrointestinal and neurological issues. When the 47-year-old from Branchburg, New Jersey, got sick last April, she had trouble getting a covid test. Once she did, her result was negative.

Ceresa has seen so many doctors since then that she can’t keep them straight. She considers herself lucky to have finally found some “fantastic” doctors, but she’s also seen plenty who didn’t believe her or tried to gaslight her — a frequent complaint of long haulers.

A couple of doctors told her they didn’t think her condition had anything to do with covid. One told her it was all in her head. And after a two-month wait to see one neurologist, he didn’t order any tests and simply told her to take vitamin B, leaving her “crying and devastated.”

“I think the negative test absolutely did that,” Ceresa said.

Fortunately, among a growing number of physicians specifically treating patients with long covid, positive test results aren’t vital. In the patient-led research, symptoms patients reported were not significantly different between those who had positive covid tests and those who had negative tests.

Dr. Monica Verduzco-Gutierrez, a rehabilitation and physical medicine doctor who leads University Health’s Post-COVID Recovery program in San Antonio, said about 12% of the patients she’s seen never had a positive covid test.

“The initial test, to me, is not as important as the symptoms,” Gutierrez said. “You have to spend a lot of time with these patients, provide education, provide encouragement and try to work on all the issues that they’re having.”

She said she tells people “what’s done is done” and, regardless of test status, “now we need to treat the outcome.”

18,Smartphone Addiction Can Ruin Sleep,"A new study published in the Frontiers of Psychiatry reinforces older studies that say smartphone addiction can ruin your sleep.

The definition of smartphone addiction, according to those who consider themselves addicted, is “a decreased interest in face-to-face relationships, use despite knowledge of the negative consequences, impaired control over and preoccupation with their devices, and anxiety when their phones are inaccessible.” These descriptors, said investigators of the sleep and smartphone study, “are not unlike the symptom domains of substance use disorders or other behavioral addictions.”

The study asked 1,043 King’s College London students, ages 18 to 30, to complete two questionnaires, online and in person, detailing their sleep quality and smartphone use. Based on the questionnaire results, researchers found that nearly 40% of the students qualified as smartphone addicts. While the study doesn’t prove a direct link, it found that those who used their smartphones the most reported a poorer sleep quality.

19,Real Water Tries to Sink the FDA’s Probe,"Last month, we reported on an FDA safety warning that connected Real Water-brand alkaline water to outbreaks of hepatitis. Since then the story has taken crime-novel-like twists and turns including disappearing personnel, roadblocks to keep investigators at bay, and the filing of a lawsuit or two.

Outbreak and recall

The investigation began when the FDA and the Southern Nevada Health District learned that Real Water was the only common denominator among five cases of nonviral hepatitis reported in Mesa, Az. The alkaline-based water is made by Real Water, owned by Affinity Lifestyles and based in Nevada.

All five identified hepatitis cases, reported in November 2020, were in young children and infants. Everyone recovered following hospitalization for acute liver failure. Older people in each household reported less severe symptoms.

On March 24th, Real Water issued a formal recall. A week later, the company was informed of the investigation’s results.

A deeper well?

It turns out, however, that the recent cases investigated by the FDA were only the tip of the iceberg. According to the Las Vegas Journal-Review , nine lawsuits have been filed against the company.

David Hilton Wise, one of the attorneys representing Real Water customers, described his clients’ conditions to include “liver failure, hospitalization, fever, vomiting, nausea, loss of appetite, and/or fatigue.” His clients, he said, “would not have purchased the product, or would have paid much less for it, if they knew that they were undertaking a risk to their health by consuming it.”

Another attorney, Will Kemp, who is handling several of the suits, said his firm represents “ dozens ” of clients sickened over a span of five years.

On March 23rd and 25th, the FDA demanded Real Water’s company records. According to the FDA, Real Water wasn’t exactly cooperative, putting up roadblocks to thwart investigators. The company denied investigators access to documents at company locations in Henderson, Nev. and Mesa, Az. On March 23rd, company owner Brent A. Jones posted a video on YouTube,apologizing to customers.

The twist

Meanwhile, the FDA said that the company has been changing its distribution information. The agency reported that “a number of distributors” in nine distribution areas covering New York to California, said they had not been notified of the recall as of March 31st.

The other side

And now for the suspense. According to the Journal Review, at a recent hearing Charles LoBello, the attorney Real Water Inc., told a judge that the plant manager and lead technician couldn’t be found. Nevertheless, the most recent Journal-Review update said the company pledged to “cooperate in every way possible” with ongoing litigation efforts and would be turning over equipment used by the company for detecting water contaminants.

As of this writing, Real Water’s website is “down for maintenance.” Affinity Lifestyles, on the Gust platform and dated 2018, makes no mention of its water’s troubles.

Not safe for you or your pets

“We are advising consumers, restaurants and retailers to not consume, cook with, sell or serve ‘Real Water’ alkaline water until more information is known about the cause of the illnesses,” Frank Yiannas, FDA deputy commissioner for Food Policy and Response, said in a statement. “We are working to determine how the alkaline water may be related to the illnesses. Although the investigation is ongoing, epidemiologic information currently indicates that this alkaline water product may be the cause of the illnesses. We will provide additional updates as more information becomes available.”

The FDA’s list of hepatitis symptoms includes “fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, clay or gray-colored bowel movements, joint pain, yellow eyes and jaundice.”

A formal recall has not been issued, but the FDA is recommending discontinuing the purchase, sale, and use of Real Water. If you have the product and are experiencing any of the above symptoms, contact your doctor. This product was also sold online.

20,A Look-See at Covid Restriction Outcomes,"In December, with two vaccines approved for emergency use, inoculations began in this country.

In mid-March, a few states began relaxing their pandemic-related restrictions, including Maryland, Texas, Mississippi, Connecticut, Arizona, West Virginia and Wyoming. Recently other states including Pennsylvania and Indiana, did the same.

On Jan.5, the number of daily cases reported was 235,027

By March 5, the number of daily cases reported was 65,739

By April 5, the number of daily cases reported was 76,594

As of April 4, 62.4 million people in this country were completely vaccinated, 19% of the country.

Earlier this week, WalletHub, the personal finance assistance website, released a new study: Which states had the least pandemic restrictions, and the most pandemic restrictions.

Medical Daily aligned those states with those with the most cases, and those with the least number of coronavirus cases.

Going one step further, we aligned those results with the number of cases per 100,000 people, which is a standardized way of comparing apples to apples.

Results may surprise you.

22,Our Best Pick for Baby Bottle ,"Regardless of how you feed your baby, watching that little body so intent on taking in nourishment, all while nestled in the crook of your arm is a sight that will disappear all too soon.

Even if you are nursing, the time will come when your baby will need a bottle.

We found in our research that bottle quality is not uniformly spread among all brands.

We feel that the best option out there is the Comotomo Natural-Feel Baby Bottle.

Available in either a 5 oz. or 8 oz. size, the Comotomo bottle is designed for newborns and older babies alike. Made from BPA-free silicone so the bottle is both dishwasher and microwave safe, this bottle features a naturally shaped nipple so your baby has no adjustment issues going from bottle to breast and vice versa. The shape makes for easier cleaning. Leak-free and heat-resistant, it also features dual anti-colic vents that helps reduce colic, spit-up and gas. Lastly, the bottles are competitively priced.

With 17,000 reviews and a 4.5/5 rating on sites like Amazon and Walgreens, the Comotomo is apparently a baby and parent favorite. One reviewer praised the shape, saying the bottle is easy to hold and that the nipple design made it easy for babies to latch onto. Other reviewers liked the bottle's easy cleanup, pricing and anti-colic feature.

The Comotomo Natural-Feel baby bottle receives our recommendation as the best feeding bottle for both newborns and older toddlers.",www.medicaldaily.com
23,Our Favorite Toy Pick for Babies 3 Months and Up ,"Photo by Manhattan Toy



With a newborn baby, it may seem like all you do is feed, change diapers and decipher the source for the latest meltdown. But even in the earliest of days, you should add playing with your child to that list, even if it seems like he can’t do much at this point. The earlier you do play, the earlier the baby’s cognitive development will begin, which will help her make sense of the world around her as she grows.

You can do this by giving them toys that are not only safe, but age-appropriate and will provide them with enough stimulation for their brains while also letting them have fun. The toy that we found that meets all these criteria is the Manhattan Toy Winkel Rattle and Teether.

Suitable for babies 3 months and up, this toy rattle and teether fits the bill for parents who are in need of a baby break and on a budget, as it’s designed to last, safe, easy to clean, and is something the baby won’t outgrow quickly. Consisting of several little brightly colored plastic loops that attach to a polka-dot patterned center cube (that also works as a soft rattle), the toy is designed to hold the baby's attention, especially when she starts grabbing things, like mom’s earrings. As for safety features, the toy is large enough to prevent those kinds of horrors, and it’s BPA- and PVC-free, thereby meeting the US Consumer Protection Safety Commission's, and other safety agencies requirements' for phthalates.

The toy also works as a teether, and popping it into the freezer before giving it to your child should do the trick. It’s best however, for simple playtime that involves clutching, shaking the rattle and promoting two-hand play.

The product has more than 17,000 positive reviews, along with a perfect 5-star rating. Parents especially love the versatility of the toy, with one writing that it went from teaching her son how to grasp things to teaching him coordination. The rattle is also praised by parents who want peace and quiet, as it’s neither too loud nor irritating. The teething option has also been well-praised, as does the product’s overall affordable price point.

The Manhattan Toy Winkel Rattle and Teether is our top recommended developmental toy for your growing baby.

24,It’s the Second Inning: MLB vs Covid,"Baseball season is finally here, but the pandemic is still on the mound. 2021 marks the second year these two have met, and the odds aren’t as drastic for the ballplayers as last year -- some fans have been allowed back in the stands, thanks to rising vaccination rates. Still, rising case numbers, multiple variants, and a patchwork of local ordinances stand in the way of traditional normalcy. Here’s what to expect during the season.

Covid and Sports

2020 reshaped sports and gave us some of the most valuable case studies in Covid-19 containment, from the NBA’s zero-case bubble in Disney World and NHL’s hub city campuses to home city plans by the MLB and the NFL . The CDC even partnered with the NFL for a full analysis of the NFL’s fall 2020 season. Not all efforts were successful-- a single high-profile lapse at the end of the World Series brought the LA Dodgers five cases.

How players and staff stay safe

Individual teams are responsible for their own Covid-19 action plans, but there are some standards set out by the MLB. Teams will have their own Infection Control prevention coordinators, compliance officers, facemask enforcement officers, contact tracing officers, and contact tracing working group in addition to medical staff.

The main protection measures are frequent testing, isolating people who test positive, and taking precautionary measures to minimize exposure inside and outside the league.

When at club facilities, face coverings and contact tracing tags will be worn at all times to detect potential exposures. Anyone who tests positive will isolate for at least 10 days, while close contacts will have to isolate for 7 days and test negative on day 5. These rules are being taken seriously, and they’re already having an impact -- the Nats had 5 players and a staffer miss opening day.

Outside league events, the players are required to observe strict guidelines based on CDC recommendations. They’ll initially only be prohibited from going to indoor gatherings and public venues like restaurants, theaters, and gyms. As the full season starts and teams travel, their bubble will contract until the Championship Season, when they will be isolating at their hotel except for a handful of team and exercise-related exceptions

There will also be modifications to game rules, which can be found here.

ESPN reports that players and field staff will enjoy loosened restrictions once their team reaches 85% vaccination, allowing them to gather indoors, congregate maskless among other vaccinated people, and travel more freely.

What you’ll find at a game

For starters, a lot fewer fans. The specifics will vary from state to state and city to city, but it’s a safe bet that most stadiums (with some notable exceptions ) won’t be holding their usual capacity. For an example, we’ll look at the rules for attending a Phillies game at Citizens Bank Park.

You won’t be getting close to the players -- they’re strictly prohibited from having direct contact with fans, and no fans will be allowed within 12 feet of the dugouts or ballpen.

You’ll have to wear a face covering to get in, and they can only come off when actively eating and drinking -- and only in your seat. Tailgating is a no-go in Philly this year, though rival Dallas will allow tailgaters in specific, socially-distanced spots.

To facilitate social distancing, fans will be assigned specific entry gates on their tickets and allowed to sit in pre-arranged pods. Variations of this plan are in place at many stadiums across the country.

What you may not need, according to a memo reported by the LA Times , are Covid-19 tests or vaccinations. Those requirements will be left to local authorities and will vary based on location. The Phillies and Cowboys, for instance, aren’t requiring either. To attend a Yankees or Mets game, on the other hand, you’ll need one or the other.

There’s a long list of terms and conditions attached to buying a baseball ticket, and now there are Covid-19 related ones, too. The full list can be found on the MLB site.

What if I am vaccinated?

It’s not likely that much will change for vaccinated fans. CDC guidelines still require masking and social distancing in public even after receiving a vaccine, and it’s unlikely that many stadiums will relax those rules. Vaccinated people may have some small perks, though, like the aforementioned waiving of Covid-19 tests before Yankees and Mets games.

The future

MLB commissioner Rob Manfred, on the MLB website, said he is hopeful that full stadiums will be the norm later this year. ""I hope by midsummer that we have ballparks that are unrestricted and we have full-fan access.""

It’s a nice vision, but perhaps an overly optimistic one as cases rise across the country and experts warn of further waves.

“We're an outdoor sport,” Manfred continued, “I think it's safe or safer to go to outdoor activities. Everybody seems to agree on that. And I think that there's pent-up demand for entertainment products, and we're going to do everything we possibly can to … to take advantage of that.""

25,Medical Daily's Best Diaper Choice for Eczema and Sensitive Skin,"Ever spent time playing with your baby and noticed red and blotchy skin where it touches the diaper? Or, have you found that certain lotions and creams cause irritation? Your baby’s skin might be sensitive, and your diaper of choice might be aggravating the issue.

Diaper manufacturers today use technologies to create types designed to either help them stay drier for longer, or make them more effective. There are also babies that only find problems in these innovations.

These often lead to diaper rash, which then leads to discomfort and tears. Diaper manufacturers have created options for those babies with both eczema and sensitive skin. We have found that the best of the bunch is The Honest Company Club Box Diapers.

Made from plant-based materials that make them eco-friendly, these hypoallergenic and hyper-absorbent diapers are made for babies with eczema and sensitive skin. Comfort is also guaranteed due to the elastic waistbands, stretchy side panels and fastening tabs. There’s also the cloud-like liner to comfort your baby’s delicate skin all while it works to keep moisture away. The diaper has a multi-layer design that offers protection from leaks -- up to 17% of its weight. Lastly, the diaper’s bio-based core is made from sustainably harvested fluff pulp, which is comfortable for babies with eczema issues. The product itself is free from any latex, chlorine, fragrances or lotions that can potentially aggravate the skin.

The diaper holds a 4.5 star rating alongside rave reviews in Amazon, with satisfied parents writing that they think The Honest Company has made the best biodegradable diaper on the market, but also its product is a great choice for the budget-minded. The selling point, however, is just how effective these diapers are at keeping your baby’s sensitive skin rash and irritation-free, while multiple reviewers said the diapers are even softer than they used to be. The price point has also been praised.

We therefore recommend The Honest Company Club Box Diapers for protecting your baby’s sensitive skin from rashes, irritations or even eczema.

26,Our Top Pick for Baby Monitor,"In the days before baby monitors, bedtime and naptime were (and still are) deserved respites for parents. But they didn’t necessarily relax during these periods. Leaving baby alone on the second floor of the house or way down a hall usually prompted a few visits to the nursery to see if all was well. But with a monitor, parents can breathe a little easier. That cry will let them know if they are needed.

But which monitor should you buy? Our recommendation is the Nanit Plus Camera. Here’s why.

Made for parents with a more flexible budget for baby equipment, the Nanit Plus is a high-end baby monitor that delivers what it promises. Named one of the best inventions of 2018 by TIME Magazine, this baby monitor features two-way audio, a night light with gradual dimming, night vision, smart sensors and more.

The 960-pixel HD camera features night vision for easier baby tracking. There are two models for mounting the camera, either on a wall or using a floor stand. Using the monitor in an open space like the living room, for example, is as easy as propping it in the room of a nursery. Also, using the monitor with your smartphone lets you hear baby even while other apps are open or while your screen is locked. For an additional fee (after one year) the Nanit will track the length and sleeping pattern of your baby.

The Nanit Plus Camera is an Amazon’s choice product, garnering thousands of rave reviews and a 4/5 rating. Satisfied parents like how well the camera connects with their smartphone (as well as how patient the Nanit support team is), while others praised the Nanit for being easy to move and set up. The camera and its features are also praised highly, and a number of parents also noted the insights that the camera provides, which according to them, helps them get “closer” to their baby even when they’re far away.

The Nanit Plus Camera is our recommended high-end baby monitor that should stand the test of time… or more babies down the road.

27,Our Best Choice for Baby Teether,"As your baby grows older he will face teething, a stressful stage for both baby and parent.

While cutting teeth is a pediatric milestone, the first few that erupt tend to be the most painful, especially for infants. As a result, your baby might want to bite something that will provide sweet relief from the pain. This is where teethers come into the picture.

Teethers give babies with sore gums something safe to chew on, a secure alternative to literally everything else they can bite, including you. Here is what we learned about Sophie La Giraffe.

Made by Vulli and considered a classic at this point, this teether/toy has been well trusted for over 55 years. Praised by parents, this 100% rubber giraffe is soft and squishy, making it perfect for sore gums. The toy’s pattern and squeaking sounds also help with visual and hearing stimulation, while the long chewy limbs help reach parts of the mouth that other teethers can’t. And for the long run, the giraffe can serve as a reassuring and comfortable friend to your baby as she grows up. You even get an included Sophie story that you can read to your child.

The giraffe has a perfect 5-star rating, alongside more than 11,000 positive reviews. For example, one review praises the teether for not only being soft, but for its perfect toddler-friendly size. One reviewer called it a godsend for helping ease her baby’s sore gums, while another said the giraffe is a night-time companion. The teether’s price and quality appear well regarded.

Therefore, Sophie La Giraffe is our top choice for teething babies.

28,Our Prime Find for A Hair Strengthening Shampoo,"Thin may be in for body shapes, but not for tresses.

Hair loss (or fall) is normal, especially a few months after handling a stressful situation, so worrying about the few hairs you see after washing your hair or brushing it isn’t worth your time. Nevertheless, the emotional impact caused by actual hair loss and thinning can be significant if left untreated.

But don’t panic yet. While there are many reasons for hair thinning, there are also many products designed to help, including shampoo.

Kérastase Densifique Bodifying Shampoo is one such shampoo.

With a reputation for having one of the best hair-strengthening products out there, Kérastase Densifique is made to preserve and thicken existing hair. Containing hair strengthening ingredients like intra-cylane, which helps increase hair thickness, as well as strengthening ceramides, this shampoo also will help with breakage. It also contains hyaluronic acid, which strengthens the hair, according to Kérastase.

The shampoo has more than 1,000 positive reviews on Amazon and a 4.5 star rating. One reviewer noted that it helped her regain hair density and strength after going through a postpartum hair loss, while a man in his 50s praised it for helping bring back and maintain his “lustrous curls.” Another reviewer said that it’s particularly effective even for colored hair.

Kérastase Densifique Bodifying Shampoo stands strong as one of the best products that can help address hair breakage, so lather it up with confidence.",www.medicaldaily.com
29,Medical Daily's Top Pick for Body Skin Exfoliator,"As the -ber months settle in and the temperature starts to fall, we once again are reminded that cold weather and our skin do not exactly “vibe” with each other. Nobody likes it, but our bodies (especially our skin) take a big hit the moment snow settles in, leaving us with undesirable dry skin.

So what do you do? You take care of those dead skin cells, that’s what, and you do it using a body skin exfoliator. Feeling, and often smelling, like an indulgent treat, exfoliators usually work by sloughing away your dry and dull skin to reveal the smoother, softer, and more luminous skin underneath.

But with so many brands on the market, it can be tricky to choose which product you’d need to add to your showering routine. After doing our homework, here is our pick: Dove Exfoliating Body Polish Scrub.

At first glance, this product may not look like much, as it’s a simple body exfoliator without the bells and whistles that more expensive products have. What it does do, however, it does quite well. For starters, the Dove brand is respected in the industry, and this product should only enhance that reputation. Formulated for dry and dull skin, this body polish scrub contains Dove’s signature ¼ moisturizing cream to scrub and polish your skin, while leaving it feeling healthy and refreshed. The body scrub’s whipped, creamy texture is gentle on the skin. As an added bonus, the product also comes in different fragrances, including velvety macadamia and rice milk, lavender and coconut milk and pomegranate seeds and shea butter.

But what do the people say? One reviewer said exfoliating doesn’t have to be as rough as it sounds, and this product is proof of that. Another praised it for being affordable, while another noted how effective it is even for people with sensitive skin. And many users noted how it left their skin feeling smooth and smelling fragrant to boot.

And the price should be gentle on the wallet, too.

With a 4.5 star rating, Dove Exfoliating Body Polish Scrub is our pick for top body skin exfoliator. After all, winter is coming.

30,Anxiety and Anticipation: Rejoining a Post-COVID World,"When the True Talking Toastmasters moved to making speeches on Zoom at the pandemic's start, the group's savvy members — residents of Silicon Valley — aced the technology. But they missed the human touch.

Some members felt remote meetings slowed their progress in polishing public speaking skills, club president Bhavesh Shah says. ""The feel of the audience, when they're sitting right in front of you in person, is very different than the online audience, some of whom might be distracted. The level of engagement was not the same.""

The group, based in San Jose, CA, also missed fun outings, like their picnics and winery tours.

When will the club meet in person again? When public health guidance says it's safe, Shah says. But he sees a gradual shift to a post-pandemic world, perhaps with hybrid meetings that allow in-person or remote attendance. Members can choose, depending on their comfort levels.

Now that COVID-19 vaccines and CDC guidelines are letting us return to a more normal lifestyle, the prospect has triggered many emotions in Americans, from yearning and exhilaration to dread and panic. Whether you're an introvert or extrovert, a return to ""normal"" prompts strong feelings.

""Some people are extremely excited and looking forward to it, and other people are downright terrified of having to go back to the public at large,"" says Jonathan Kanter, PhD, a psychologist who directs the Center for the Science of Social Connection at the University of Washington.

In fact, a March 2021 survey by the American Psychological Association found that about half of respondents said they felt uneasy about returning to in-person interaction once the pandemic ends.

A Return to Public Life

Not Tam Le. ""I would love to get back to in-person meeting,"" says Le, a vice president with True Talking Toastmasters. ""I can't wait until I can actually do so."" She recruited a friend to join the group, but ""he told me only when the club goes to in-person will he come back."" English isn't his first language, she says, so he's more comfortable communicating in person.

Shah says he welcomes in-person meetings as long as people take proper precautions, but adds, ""I have mixed feelings."" As a tech professional, he believes that virtual communication will become a permanent part of our lives. ""Business itself in general is now going to be in a hybrid mode,"" he says. ""You will be using the technology to interact with other people that you need to interact with, be it your customers, co-workers, or stakeholders.""

He favors perhaps a monthly, remote-only Toastmasters meeting ""just to keep our virtual presentation skills sharp,"" he says. ""It is a necessary skill that comes in handy from time to time, not just when the next pandemic starts.""

https://twitter.com/Ulam_Writes/status/1372007393551323136

Paige Skinner, a 30-year-old freelance journalist, has weathered the entire pandemic at her parents' home in the Dallas area. ""I don't want the pandemic to last any longer. I know people are suffering. Half a million Americans are dead,"" she says.

But sheltering in the family home has been a welcome pause during an uncertain time, especially since her work has slowed down. ""One of the reasons I'm selfishly hesitant for the pandemic to end is because I have to figure out my life once it does,"" she says. ""I'm super-privileged, and I'm aware of that.""

Skinner has left the house to shop for groceries and get takeout food but hasn't dated or socialized to protect herself and her parents, who are in their late 60s. In October, she did dine outdoors at a restaurant with friends, but she didn't feel relaxed. ""It was really stressful, even being outside,"" she says.

Skinner still doesn't know what her post-pandemic future holds. But when she starts dating again, she'll size up potential partners differently, she says.

""I've stayed inside for pretty much an entire year. I don't want to date anyone who didn't take this pandemic seriously, who put anyone at risk or inadvertently put my parents at risk. That just boils down to selfishness, and obviously, I don't want to date a selfish person. That's definitely going to be a difficult thing to navigate once I do start dating again.""

Others have taken to social media to air their post-pandemic fears. Maxwell Porter tweeted, ""Have we come up with a word for being afraid of life after the pandemic?"" Twitter user A Bee wrote, ""After the pandemic is over with and we can go out without masks, I will be terribly afraid of getting sick for probably the rest of my life.""

Transition Phase

We're still transitioning to a post-pandemic world, but Le should have no trouble re-entering public life. As a real estate agent, she showed homes during the pandemic. Others might take a middle-of-the-road approach, happily keeping some of the pandemic year's changes in their lives. For example, many introverts might choose to maintain a slower, quieter lifestyle.

But what about the many uneasy folks among us — those who don't want to isolate forever but feel nervous about seeing others again? ""The fact that the disease was literally socially transmitted, it resulted in us being scared of contact with other people,"" Kanter says. ""And then the mandates to isolate and limit social contact further created this sense of social threat."" Those with a history of anxiety or social anxiety might feel even more frightened.

It's too soon to know whether the pandemic will create lasting changes to our social interactions, but experts emphasize that connection has always been crucial to our species.

""Our need to be part of a social group, this is built into being human,"" Kanter says. ""I think if anything, among the many lessons of the pandemic, it's really made it clear to people how important our relationships are.""

For teenagers with social anxiety, interacting with peers creates fears of being embarrassed or rejected. While anxious teens seem primed to be ""introverted and self-contained,"" says W. Keith Sutton, PsyD, director of the Bay Area Center for Anxiety, ""there are also a lot of folks who feel lonely.""

https://twitter.com/TheLizWhite/status/1386698479821594625

He's seen teens in the San Francisco Bay Area yearning for the physical company of peers, ""even though it was a source of distress,"" he says. ""Oftentimes, there's a great wish to be social and connected, and also at the same time being terrified of it.""

Being connected brings health benefits, Kanter says.

""We know that people who are lonely and socially isolated are more likely to die younger,"" he says. ""We know that when you're lonely or socially disconnected, your immune functioning is disrupted, your cardiovascular functioning is disrupted. Your mental health is affected, of course. Loneliness is probably the strongest predictor of depression among all of the many predictors of depression.""

As people engage again, experts aren't advocating for reckless behavior that runs counter to CDC advice, especially with the country's lack of herd immunity. But the agency has provided new guidelines that nudge us toward normal life again.

For example, it states that in general, fully vaccinated people no longer need to wear masks outdoors, unless they're in crowded places, such as stadiums and concerts. Given the low risk of outdoor transmission, even unvaccinated people can go maskless if they're walking or exercising outdoors with their own household.

But they still need to wear masks while dining outdoors with friends from multiple households, while those of us who are fully vaccinated no longer need to.

It's Not Unusual to Be Nervous

It's normal for people to feel anxious about adapting to more changes, including meeting in person again, says Bethany Teachman, PhD, a psychology professor at the University of Virginia and director of its Program for Anxiety, Cognition and Treatment Lab. ""There's a tendency to take a situation that's ambiguous or uncertain and assign a really threatening, negative meaning to it,"" she says.

""You should go into things expecting that things will feel strange for a while. That's a very natural reaction in light of what's been going on, and it doesn't mean that something is wrong with you if you're feeling some anxiety or stress at doing things you haven't done for a very long time,"" she says. ""When people attach a lot of negative meanings to becoming anxious and think that it means they're weak or something is terrible about them, it actually tends to make it worse.""

Instead, Teachman says, ""What we want to help people do is figure out: How do you take the right level of precautions so that you're doing things responsibly to stay safe and yet not live in a state of constant threat and constant fear?""

People can build up contact slowly, she says, assuming that they're safely following CDC guidelines. ""First, you can meet with one or two people doing something outdoors that you haven't been doing. Then you can work up to meeting with a few people indoors,"" she says. ""You can do it step-by-step and build up so that each step adds a little bit of challenge. But you don't have to go from zero to 100 in terms of level of difficulty.""

https://twitter.com/ILikeFilms/status/1382130836733100033

Considering one's goals and values can be motivating, too, according to Teachman. Don't deny your anxiety, she says. ""Instead, think about: Are your goals to reconnect with a friend you haven't had a chance to see in a long time?…Think about why you're doing those kinds of interactions,"" she says. ""That can be what guides you, rather than being guided by, 'Hey, do I feel anxious or not?' ""

As we emerge into post-pandemic life, we can expect lots of false alarms to go off, Teachman says. ""It's likely to be the case that when we're told that it's physically safe to do something again, it still creates a lot of apprehension. That false alarm is going off because we've learned that alarm over the last year or so when it was adaptive. But now, it's no longer as sensible to have that alarm going off. We don't want anxiety making the decision for us about what we do or don't do.""

Instead, she suggests, ""Have a systematic set of questions that you ask yourself: 'Am I assuming the worst? Is there another way to look at this situation?' Those kinds of questions will allow you to weigh the actual evidence a bit more systematically rather than just saying, 'Hey, I have this feeling, and that's what I need to respond to.'""

It can help to use accurate, up-to-date sources of information to find out what's considered low-risk, Teachman says. ""What are reliable, trusted sources during this time?"" For example, the CDC offers a chart, ""Choosing Safer Activities,"" for fully vaccinated and unvaccinated people alike. By using a plan instead of feelings to guide choices, ""It will make it less overwhelming and out-of-control,"" she says.

If people are really struggling to resume their lives, they should seek professional help, she says. ""That desire to avoid is really strong when you're anxious, but it makes the problem so much worse. The more people say, 'I'm not going to go do this, it's not OK to do this — all of those kinds of things — it's going to get harder over time for that individual to re-enter situations.""

Making Her Way Back

As for Skinner, she's slowly making her way forward from the pandemic. ""I'm fully vaccinated, so I'm on my way to going back to normal. Now, I'm going out and eating at restaurants. I got a haircut yesterday, which is the first time in a year.""

After a long season of fear and foreboding, she's surprised at how quickly she adapted. ""I think there's a level of comfort knowing that I'm fully vaccinated now,"" she says.

https://twitter.com/ceh901/status/1383208517935448065

When she began dining indoors again, ""It was honestly weird because it felt completely normal. I thought that I'd sit there and freak out and want to cover my face the entire time, but it's weird how quickly my body just went back to normal, like everything was fine. I guess if you've eaten inside restaurants for 30 years, one year out didn't make a big difference.""

In May, she'll take her first flight in more than a year. ""I guess I'm a little worried about that. Flying kind of feels like a hotbed"" for the coronavirus, she says. ""Of course, I'll wear my mask and I'll take all the precautions and be as careful as possible. But hopefully, being fully vaccinated will protect me.""

She'll be on her way to attend a wedding in New Orleans.

31,"Heart Failure May Hit COVID Patients, Even Without CVD History ","Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 could be at risk of developing heart failure (HF), even in the absence of a history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) or cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF), new research suggests.

Investigators retrospectively analyzed the electronic medical records of close to 1600 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19, 37 of whom developed HF. Of these, eight patients had no history of CVD or CVRF.

""New diagnoses of acute heart failure were relatively infrequent amongst patients hospitalized with COVID-19,"" Anuradha Lala, MD, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York City, told theheart.org | Medscape Cardiology.

Nevertheless, because ""symptoms of heart failure — particularly shortness of breath — can mimic symptoms associated with COVID-19, being alerted to the findings of this study might prompt clinicians to monitor for signs of congestion more consistent with heart failure than COVID-19 alone,"" she said in a press release.

The letter was published online April 26 in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.

""Elusive"" Mechanisms

Although there have been reports of precipitation of HF in the setting of COVID-19, population-based studies ""are needed to provide a context within which the frequency of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2)-related HF can be appreciated,"" the authors write.

To further examine the issue, the researchers analyzed medical records of 6439 patients with COVID-19 (mean age, 64 years; 45% female), who had been admitted to Mount Sinai hospitals between February 27 and June 26, 2020. Patients were then followed until October 7, 2020.

Of the patients, 6.6% had a history of HF and 0.6% developed new HF during their hospitalization: 13 presented with shock (four cardiogenic, six septic, and three mixed), and five presented with acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

""Remarkably, 8 patients (22%) had neither CVRF nor CVD, while 14 (38%) had a history of CVD, and 15 (40%) had at least 1 CVRF,"" the authors report.

They note that patients with neither CVRF nor CVD were younger than those with these conditions (mean age, 43 vs 73 years, respectively). They were also mostly male, had lower body mass, and had fewer comorbidities (such as respiratory or renal disease), compared with other new HF patients.

Risk for admission to the intensive care unit was higher in patients with new HF than in those without HF (32% vs 17%), as was risk for intubation (24% vs 12%). However, risk for mortality was similar in the two groups (27% vs 25%).

And patients with new HF had higher concentrations of troponin and B-type higher natriuretic peptide (BNP) plasma levels than patients without CVRF and CVD.

Cardiac Biomarkers With and Without a History of CVD or Risk Factors Patients With HF Troponin, ng/mL BNP, pg/mL History of CVRF 0.03 163 History of CVD 0.18 356 No history of CVRF or CVD 221.45 588

Despite the higher frequency of cardiogenic shock and ACS in the eight new HF patients without CVRF or CVD, length of hospital stay was similar to that of the other patients with new HF.

""The mechanisms by which one may develop new HF in the setting of COVID-19 remain elusive, but may include indirect effects of acute illness or direct viral injury,"" Lala commented.

""Interesting imaging studies of patients post-COVID-19 have demonstrated fibrosis of the heart on cardiac MRI, so following patients longitudinally will be important for understanding mechanisms and time course,"" she said.

Close Follow-up

Commenting in the study for theheart.org | Medscape Cardiology, Biykem Bozkurt, MD, PhD, Mary and Gordon Cain Chair and Professor of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, said the findings are ""in line with former reports that COVID-19 infection can affect the heart and result in myocardial injury, myocardial dysfunction, and heart failure.""

It is ""important to recognize cardiac involvement in patients with COVID-19 infection and it is critical to triage patients appropriately,"" said Bozkurt, who is the immediate past president of the Heart Failure Society of America and senior associate editor of Circulation.

Patients with mild to moderate symptoms of COVID-19 with evidence of cardiac involvement from biomarkers or imaging ""need to be followed-up closely to determine resolution of symptoms, signs, and cardiac involvement,"" emphasized Bozkurt, who was not involved with the study.

Lala encouraged clinicians to ""be alert to look for signs and symptoms of heart failure beyond shortness of breath, which may be present in acute COVID-19 illness.""

Lala recommended looking at markers of congestion, measuring biomarkers, and obtaining an echocardiogram in select cases where symptoms of heart failure appear more apparent, ""particularly in those patients with risk factors for or overt cardiovascular disease which may predispose risk for heart failure.""

The authors conclude that ""understanding specific mechanisms underlying the manifestation of COVID-19 as new HF warrants further study.""

32,An Unorthodox Allergy Clinic Seeks to Disrupt Medicine,"Carrie Martin had a two-part systemto protect her food-allergic daughter from accidental exposures to peanuts or sesame. Martin scoured ingredient lists at the grocery store. Her husband re-checked them at home before cooking meals. ""We thought our system was so foolproof,"" said Martin, a teacher in Ormond Beach, Florida.

But once, in 2012, Martin unwittingly grabbed the wrong pizza crust at the grocery store. After her daughter coughed, threw up, turned red, and got treated in the emergency room, they pulled the wrapper out of the trash and realized why — the pizza had contained sesame. Years later, in 2018, the family experienced another scare. Some restaurant-baked bread sent their daughter into anaphylaxis, a life-threatening allergic reaction that required two epinephrine injections and a trip to the hospital.

""It's like you're back to ground zero again,"" Martin said. A single reaction can plunge even the most vigilant food allergy families back into what-ifs and panic.

Six months after the restaurant emergency, Martin found herself perusing the website of a promising — yet decidedly unorthodox — allergy clinic located in Long Beach, California. Martin had never been one to seriously explore treatment options, but the Southern California Food Allergy Institute advertised something different. Not only did this institute offer hope beyond a life of EpiPens and strict avoidance — it claimed that patients who finish treatment can freely eat the foods they were allergic to.

Until last year, the Food and Drug Administration had not approved any treatments for food allergies, which afflict an estimated 32 million people in the United States. By the late 2000s, a handful of pioneering allergists were starting to use a procedure called oral immunotherapy (OIT), which tames a person's allergies through daily ingestion of small amounts of store-bought foods. But the procedure is not a cure. For the most part, it can train the body to tolerate, say, two peanuts or a half glass of milk — just enough to keep accidental exposures from escalating into the serious reactions Martin's daughter experienced.

Over the past decade, the OIT cottage industry has grown to about 200 practitioners, according to one allergist's estimate, and their private clinics have treated more than 15,000 patients. Some allergists have started using standardized peanut-powder capsules that work on the same low-dose exposure principle after the FDA approved their use in January 2020. Still, most U.S. board-certified allergists do not offer food immunotherapy. The treatment remains controversial because it's time-consuming, can trigger allergic reactions, and doesn't work for everyone. In some studies, OIT treatment was unsuccessful in 15 to 30 percent of patients.

SoCal Food Allergy, as the institute is popularly known, grew out of a one-man operation that started in the basement of a nearby hospital in 2004. The institute offers individualized treatment using a method that some allergists say resembles OIT but which its founder argues is fundamentally different. Unlike OIT, which exposes patients to incrementally increasing amounts of their allergens alone, SoCal's program leans on mathematics and machine learning to determine customized dosing schemes using a range of foods. The goal is to build patients' tolerance to related foods and then introduce the allergen once their immune systems are less reactive.

According to figures provided by the institute, at least 11,000 such patients have been treated or are being treated with SoCal's Tolerance Induction Program, and more than 5,000 have reached remission — meaning they can ""eat whatever they want, whenever they want, in unlimited quantities, without fear of reaction."" SoCal Food Allergy reports a 99 percent success rate for its program, with a side effect rate considerably lower than those reported for private-practice oral immunotherapy.

Martin put her daughter on the SoCal waitlist in January 2019. Roughly 1,350 families were ahead of her, and Martin was told the wait would be about 13 months. ""I was totally fine with that,"" she said.

As Martin's daughter moved up the waitlist, though, she began to panic about logistics and cost. The thought of committing her child to a treatment that required cross-country trips every few months weighed on Martin. SoCal Food Allergy has an annual program charge of $4,500. According to parents of program participants, this fee was originally considered a donation, briefly became a mandatory ""tax-deductible contribution,"" and now is a non-tax-deductible fee. And by 2019, the institute had switched to in-house lab testing that was not yet covered by all insurers, forcing families to pay thousands of dollars out of pocket for a set of required tests that used to be done by companies such as Quest Diagnostics and were usually at least partially covered by insurance.

Martin also had doubts about the institute's self-reported results. ""It seemed,"" she said, ""too good to be true.""

Allergists have expressed similar skepticism about SoCal Food Allergy's reported results. ""Come on, there's no way,"" said Hugh Windom, whose Sarasota, Florida clinic has treated about 500 patients with oral immunotherapy since 2012. Philippe Bégin, an allergist and researcher at the University of Montreal in Canada, called the 99 percent success ""just ridiculous."" And while Edwin Kim, an allergist and immunologist at the University of North Carolina, said he wanted to ""give them the benefit of the doubt,"" he added: ""I'd be lying if I didn't say I'm skeptical.""

In interviews with roughly a dozen allergists, many took issue with the length and expense of SoCal Food Allergy's program and its lack of peer review, which makes it hard to understand how the proprietary method works and how effective it really is.

SoCal Food Allergy's founder, Inderpal Randhawa, acknowledges the skepticism. Describing his institute's approach, he said, ""It's very unusual. I get it, most people don't work like I do. They don't have my mindset."" But as a multi-specialty physician-researcher, he sees a gap in the field that he believes he can address. Randhawa argues that his method eludes peer-reviewed publication because its machine-learning algorithms are groundbreaking and ahead of their time.

""I'm on a mission, point blank,"" he said. ""Right now, the system is antiquated,"" he said, speaking about the field of medicine broadly.

Only in the last few decades have researchers started to treat food allergies with the same desensitization approach used for more than a century to treat environmental allergies such as pollen and dust mites. There are various reasons. While watery eyes and sniffles triggered by environmental exposures are considered an annoyance, allergic reactions to food are potentially deadly. And though food allergy deaths are rare, when such incidents occur during a treatment trial, they can stall research for years, said allergist Sakina Bajowala of Kaneland Allergy and Asthma Center in Illinois. In 1991, an error caused a study participant to suffer a fatal allergic reaction to peanut, sending shockwaves through a community whose practitioners are by nature very cautious.

Only about one third of allergists surveyed in 2018 and 2019 said they administer, in any given month, more than five food challenges — a process that involves giving patients increasing amounts of a food and watching for potentially life-threatening allergic reactions. These procedures are the gold standard for diagnosing allergies, yet clinicians use them sparingly. And many shy away from offering oral immunotherapy.

This reluctance is also tied to the current regulatory framework. In order for a medication to receive FDA approval, its manufacturer must first prove that the drug is both safe and effective. This is a long, expensive process that includes testing the medication on human patients. Yet most OIT involves simple grocery store fare — milk, eggs, wheat — so it lacks the funding and standardization required for testing. And without FDA approval, insurance companies are less likely to cover the procedure.

In interviews with roughly a dozen allergists, many took issue with the length and expense of SoCal Food Allergy's program and its lack of peer review.

This is the world Randhawa entered in 2004, when he started seeing food allergy patients in the basement of Miller Children's and Women's Hospital in Long Beach. Randhawa says he took careful histories and analyzed immune cells and proteins in blood samples he collected from patients to answer basic questions: What doses of which proteins cause allergic reactions? What doses can change levels of reaction-triggering immune proteins in a patient's blood?

Undaunted by applied math and mounds of data, Randhawa says he analyzed ""weighted effects of different proteins"" and raised questions that hadn't gotten much traction among allergists — for example, if you eat a walnut and happen to be allergic to peanuts, what does the walnut do to you? How might a person's allergic responses be shaped by proteins with similar structures found in other foods or drugs or even in the environment?

The program Randhawa developed was a natural outgrowth of his curiosity and multidisciplinary training. After graduating magna cum laude with a bachelor's degree in biochemistry at the University of Southern California, Randhawa enrolled at Northwestern University's medical school in 1997. He trained in pediatrics and internal medicine, and then from 2005 to 2009, completed two fellowships, the first in allergy and clinical immunology, and the second in pulmonology, where he treated lung diseases.

During his first fellowship, Randhawa helped with a large study testing whether Xolair, an asthma drug manufactured by the biotechnology company Genentech, could prevent reactions in peanut-allergic children. As had happened in the 1991 peanut allergy study incident, a fatality at one of the Xolair sites ""basically shut down the entire nationwide trial,"" he said. Doctors and scientists started thinking that trying to treat food allergies was just too risky, said Randhawa, who lists faculty appointments at the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine and UC Irvine on his CV, among numerous other positions. Randhawa also serves as medical director of the Children's Pulmonary Institute at Miller Children's & Women's and program director for its cystic fibrosis center. ""People were saying, 'well, this is too risky, just don't do it. Don't touch this field.'""

But after seeing children die of food anaphylaxis during his residency training, Randhawa says he couldn't turn away. In the intensive care unit one night, two kids were recovering from anaphylactic reactions to similar amounts of peanut, he recalls. One was on oxygen and seemed to be stabilizing. The other lay brain dead, hooked to a ventilator. Yet when Randhawa looked up their charts, he was stunned to discover that the child on oxygen had markedly worse allergic numbers than the one who was brain dead.

Randhawa said the other physicians shrugged away the finding, but he was flabbergasted. It ""just didn't make sense to me,"" he said. The stark disconnect between metrics and outcomes resonated with an earlier personal tragedy: the sudden death of his father in 2000 from a massive heart attack, despite four negative stress tests the previous year and no significant risk factors. ""All of my time in medicine and science since has forced me to question and develop ideas well beyond my peers,"" Randhawa wrote in an email. ""This is why I am motivated and able to build faster and wider across multiple fields.""

""I'm on a mission, point blank,"" Randhawa said. ""Right now, the system is antiquated.""

As he began to question conventional protocols for diagnosing and treating life-threatening food allergies, Randhawa says he studied the physiology of anaphylaxis. He looked at immune cell populations and pathways to understand how different organs and their cells react to food. He combed through agricultural chemistry journals. He pored over plant protein databases, searching for patterns and structures, known as epitopes, in foods.

Drawn to surgery and the high-intensity ICU during his allergy and immunology training, Randhawa studied food allergies with a transplant mindset. To determine if someone can receive an organ transplant, doctors need to make sure the recipient's immune system won't reject the donor organ. Transplant surgeons compare signature molecules on the surface of cells of the donor and the recipient to be sure they match well enough.

In a similar vein, food allergies occur when specific molecules in foods prove to be a poor match for a person's immune system. Randhawa believes that over time, the immune system can be conditioned to become a better match — to tolerate its allergens — through a progression of increasing exposures to related proteins in less-triggering foods. These principles, he says, form the basis of his treatment program.

""I will put whatever amount of energy and time and money,"" he said, into seeing this through.

Randhawa's program now occupies a four-story, 30,000-square-foot institute with clinic rooms, research space, and a full-fledged testing facility — and 100,000 square feet in five additional facilities within a six-mile radius. In the last few years, SoCal Food Allergy has expanded from about 40 to more than 200 employees. Operating in conjunction with the Translational Pulmonary and Immunology Research Center — a nonprofit center founded to develop individualized treatments for rare diseases including bronchiectasis and cystic fibrosis — the food allergy institute sees something like 100 to 150 new patients a month.

Inside, researchers in white coats transfer patient samples into test tubes, technicians prepare vials of peanut butter for food challenges, and patients are greeted by personalized messages adorning the crinkly paper draped over exam beds.

What's less apparent to casual observers is that the staff treat patients with a proprietary protocol that remains shrouded in mystery. ""I went on their website and still don't understand what they do!"" one physician wrote on a recent email thread among allergists offering food allergy immunotherapy. ""It's a bit of a black box,"" another allergist replied.

To reach remission, patients must adhere to a customized plan that lasts months, often years. Treatment schemes are uniquely built for each patient using mathematical algorithms created by Randhawa and his team of data scientists and statisticians. The algorithms analyze hundreds of molecular markers — including antibodies that recognize specific parts of food and environmental allergens — in each patient's blood sample.

The number crunching generates for each patient a ""snapshot"" that classifies dozens of foods as anaphylactic, sensitized, or tolerant. ""Anaphylactic"" foods trigger allergic reactions if eaten in tiny amounts. On the other extreme, ""tolerant"" foods can be consumed freely without worry. Foods in the middle ""sensitized"" column sit in a gray area. According to the TIP Welcome Packet, moderate amounts of these foods produce ""allergic pathways and proteins"" in the blood yet may or may not cause an allergic reaction.

A person's molecular data also factors into the treatment plan, down to the order of allergens treated and the milligrams of food protein for each dose. The goal is to move each food, one by one, into the ""tolerant"" column — with tolerance confirmed through in-office food challenges.

For Martin's daughter, that meant starting the program with challenges to coconut and pumpkin seeds, foods she has eaten with no problem. ""I couldn't understand wasting the time and money to challenge two things she eats on a regular basis,"" said Martin. ""It just didn't sit well with me.""

This aspect of the approach also raised suspicion for Shannon Hill, a San Diego-area lawyer whose 3-year-old son is allergic to peanuts and wheat. ""The program claims that treating 'sensitized' and related foods first makes it safer to treat the actual allergen,"" she wrote in an email. ""It also adds years to treatment plans."" SoCal Food Allergy offered Hill's son a five-plus-year regimen that included dosing with several foods he already eats regularly with no problems. For the first year, she said testing, supplies, and the annual fee would have cost about $9,000.

Still, Hill opened herself to the possibility that SoCal Food Allergy's testing could resolve lingering questions about suspected allergies to foods her son had not yet eaten. To better understand his test results and plan, Hill searched for publications supporting the theory that pre-treating with ""sensitized"" foods makes it safer to treat a patient's allergens. Finding none, she emailed and phoned SoCal Food Allergy's doctors.

Hill found their answers vague and unsatisfactory. ""It seemed like, 'here's a protocol and you have to follow it, and there's no deviation, even if it doesn't really make sense,'"" she said. ""The cynic in me, and maybe the lawyer in me, is like, 'I need to see evidence.'"" Hill eventually withdraw her child from the program, as did Martin.

Others have balked at having to pay huge fees for tests other allergists don't typically request. ""At one point I wondered, is it for his data?"" said Alvina Leung, a Kaiser physician living in Huntington Beach, California who kept her son under Randhawa's care for six years. ""I felt like I was at his mercy."" Her son cleared his milk, egg, and tree nut allergies but kept having ""reactions out of the blue"" while trying to complete the peanut allergy program, Leung said. Eventually, Leung said, her son was discharged from the program without having fully completed it. ""It was a very rocky road.""

""The cynic in me, and maybe the lawyer in me, is like, 'I need to see evidence,'"" Hill said.

Some families appreciate the rigor and rationale of SoCal Food Allergy's method, and the institute's Facebook page includes a number of glowing reviews. Siddharth Mallick, a mechanical engineer in Houston, learned about the SoCal institute in 2015 after his son's struggles with traditional OIT. On the first OIT attempt, his son Anurag — who is allergic to dairy, peanuts, tree nuts, and some legumes — threw up for three weeks and dropped 20 percent of his body weight. Several months later he gave it another try, but the vomiting returned, along with lip and ear swelling and gastrointestinal issues. That summer Anurag stopped OIT and attempted six months of herbal therapy in New York before having to quit that as well, due to frequent reactions.

Shortly after stopping OIT, in August 2015, Mallick posted about his son's setbacks in food allergy Facebook groups, and another parent suggested SoCal Food Allergy. That family had an allergen list ""way longer than ours"" and more complications and similar GI issues, Mallick said. He and his son decided to give it a try: ""What's the worst that can happen?""

In February 2018, two and half years after joining the SoCal Food Allergy waitlist, Mallick and his son flew to Long Beach and started the program. To treat his dairy allergy, Anurag started by dosing with boiled mare milk. Its proteins are similar to those found in human breast milk — something he could tolerate. From there, he moved on to raw mare milk, sheep yogurt, goat milk, and raw camel milk. ""We call it the 'petting zoo,'"" Mallick joked.

These tailored progressions are key to the program's success and safety, Randhawa says. Each patient's dosing sequence for a given allergen is computed from measurements of how their immune system binds to various classes of proteins in that food. Pre-treating with related proteins from foods they already tolerate helps condition the body for dosing the actual allergen. ""They're already 50 percent, 75 percent less anaphylactic to it before we even start,"" Randhawa explained in a live Q&A event that was posted online.

Tricia Morphew, a biostatistician who has worked with Randhawa on research projects spanning more than a decade, wrote in an email that she believes ""his approach to mathematical models to be sensible and sound."" Ajaz Hussain, a former deputy director of the Office of Pharmaceutical Science at the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, watched a video describing SoCal's precision medicine approach and found it ""very attractive."" Its use of demographic and individual measurements to characterize the immune response to food allergens and derive a sequential protocol to alleviate the problem, is likely ""the methodology for the future,"" Hussain said.

Likewise, many families, even without understanding the algorithms and analytics behind the elaborate treatment schemes, believe Randhawa is onto something — and willingly shell out thousands of dollars to find out. ""I know it's costing us, for sure. But it's got to be worth it, because it's your kid,"" said Craig Folven, president of a flooring distribution company in Eagan, Minnesota, whose son started TIP last May.

For Greg Neuman, as well, SoCal Food Allergy offered hope for his 4-year-old son. Still, after flying the family out from New Jersey for the intake appointment in October 2019, they decided not to continue. ""Something rubbed me the wrong way,"" Neuman said of SoCal's secrecy. ""It flies in the face of most of the things that I believe about science. You know, if someone was sitting on a cure for cancer or Alzheimer's and wasn't sharing it, I'd be very suspicious.""

Indeed, in interviews with Undark, numerous allergists expressed concern about the SoCal clinic's approach, yet many hesitated to go on record criticizing a method that has not been published in a reputable, peer-reviewed journal. Some details about Tolerance Induction Program methods are described in Randhawa's 2019 paper in the Journal of Allergy and Therapy, whose content is freely available. However, some such open-access journals have a dubious perception among researchers as pay-to-publish scams.

For Matt Bell, an allergist in Fayetteville, Arkansas, that was the first red flag. ""I've never heard of that journal before,"" he said. ""If your data is that great, why did you go that route?""

Another head-scratcher: Unlike typical food immunotherapy studies, TIP patients in this study did not have to undergo a food challenge to confirm their allergies at the start of treatment. ""It's easy to overdiagnose,"" said Brian Schroer, director of allergy and immunology at Akron Children's Hospital in Ohio. Without mandatory challenges, he said it's possible for some patients to finish the program ""'free eating' simply because they never were allergic.""

""It flies in the face of most of the things that I believe about science. You know, if someone was sitting on a cure for cancer or Alzheimer's and wasn't sharing it, I'd be very suspicious,"" said Neuman.

The published study's retrospective design and enigmatic entry criteria left more room for suspicion. The abstract summarizes ""a descriptive study in 51 peanut-allergic children"" whose molecular markers were assessed in skin and blood tests conducted before undergoing TIP and one year later. As the paper acknowledged, there was no placebo group. ""They picked 51 people, and they've treated thousands,"" Bell said. ""To me, it seemed a little bit cherry-picked,"" Bell added.

""Is that representative of the whole group?"" he asked.

According to Randhawa, the patients were not cherry-picked. The institute's algorithms group patients into five endotypes, or subtypes, according to levels of antibody responses to various plant proteins, as determined by analyzing blood samples. The paper analyzed those 51 patients because they fell into the same endotype, meaning they shared a ""reproducible set of signals"" from the program's data analytics and received treatment over a specified 30-month timeframe, Randhawa wrote in an email. Yet ""the journals would not allow a definition of endotype since it is based on mathematical criteria of biomarkers.""

As for food challenges, study patients were offered them, but none wanted to proceed ""given their severe history,"" Randhawa wrote. He noted that many OIT clinics also do not routinely food-challenge patients. SoCal Food Allergy does ""an objective intake history"" and only treats patients whose intake history and molecular markers are consistent with anaphylactic risk, he said.

Randhawa said he has received ""way more than"" a half dozen rejections from more well-regarded allergy journals when trying to publish this paper and others.

Amanda Lee, a homeschooling mom in Concord, California whose 12-year-old son went through TIP treatment for a peanut allergy, said that when he started in 2013, she was told the method ""didn't have enough patients at the time to make the statistics work for publishing."" Randhawa's goal was to reach a thousand patients, Lee said. ""He and I talked about publications a couple of times about two or three years into the program, and he was all super excited and I totally expected them to come out within a year.""

The fact that the method was unpublished when her son did the program ""doesn't bother me,"" Lee said. ""I've seen lots of people have tremendous success with it."" Still, Lee withdrew her son in 2018 due to uncontrolled allergic reactions during the maintenance phase, when patients consume their allergens on a less frequent basis to sustain tolerance. In the last four years, some 100 patients have dropped out for various reasons, including financial and personal, according to an email from Mega Jewell, who was the head of public affairs at the Southern California Food Allergy Institute at the time of the email. Without publishing studies in a peer-reviewed journal, ""not only can you not prove [the method] works, you can't disprove it,"" said Schroer.

The foundation of science is peer review, Hussain said. If the institute continues to use a non-validated method, ""they are potentially going to damage an evolving methodology."" Because SoCal Food Allergy's methods are mathematical, Hussain said, they should be peer-reviewed by experts in artificial intelligence. Once suitable experts have vetted the technical aspects, he said, then physician peer reviewers could assess whether the method works as a food allergy treatment.

Randhawa has presented or co-authored in more than 100 academic conferences, peer-reviewed publications, and educational lectures since 2005, according to his CV. And he published more than 20 papers between 2009 and 2020 — mostly on asthma, cystic fibrosis, and other diseases besides food allergy, including those studied at the research center Randhawa established in 2015.

Randhawa has had a harder time publishing food allergy research. When plant protein databases and statistical ""mixed-model"" analytics come into play, as they do in SoCal Food Allergy's treatment approach, ""the system does not quite know how to handle it,"" he said.

""The reviewers will say the same thing. They'll say, 'Well, we don't understand this concept. We don't understand the analytics,'"" Randhawa said. Editors have suggested submitting the work to a mathematics or statistics journal. They've said ""there are no reviewers in the field of allergy who are on our editorial board who feel comfortable reviewing this,"" according to Randhawa.

Gailen Marshall, Jr., editor-in-chief of the Annals of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, confirmed that Randhawa submitted two papers to the journal in 2018, both of which were rejected. Marshall did not respond to questions about the grounds for rejection, noting that he was ""enforcing an expectation of privacy that all authors who submit to our journal have.""

Once, Randhawa sent the manuscript to editors of a food chemistry journal. But they, too, said ""'this sounds too mathematical, and too allergic. We don't know what to do with it,'"" Randhawa said.

""I have a choice, right? I can either continue to play the typical academic game,"" Randhawa said, ""or I can actually try to treat the patients in an organized, regulated, methodical fashion that follows molecular markers.""

The Tension Between Randhawa and traditional allergists is nowhere near settled. Several years ago SoCal Food Allergy put out various social media posts and videos with charts comparing TIP's success and side effect rates with those that had been reported for food immunotherapy trials conducted by the Consortium for Food Allergy Research (CoFAR), a government-funded program established in 2005 by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to support clinical research on food allergies. SoCal Food Allergy's claims met with skepticism.

""They were touting to be better than anything that CoFAR ever did,"" said allergist and immunologist Kari Nadeau, director of the Sean N. Parker Center for Allergy and Asthma Research at Stanford University, one of CoFAR's seven research sites, and co-author of ""The End of Food Allergy."" ""We're like, what? Let's learn about this. Let's figure this out. Let's share it, right? What's your magic because we want to test it.""

Scott Sicherer, director of one of the CoFAR sites, the Jaffe Food Allergy Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, had a phone conversation with Randhawa in January 2019. Sicherer said he offered to be ""an honest broker to test his approach"" in about nine Mount Sinai patients per month — perhaps a hundred over the course of a year. The patients would be treated at Mount Sinai according to a personalized TIP plan based on data from skin and blood tests. According to Sicherer, Randhawa said he would present the proposal to SoCal Food Allergy's board of directors and respond in a few weeks, but that never happened.

In an email message to Undark, Randhawa said that Sicherer was supposed to go back to his own board to obtain funding information. ""He never followed up on his end,"" Randhawa said. Ultimately, the standoff was moot. Randhawa, who said he recalls Sicherer offering to treat a smaller number of patients in a year, said he had no interest in trying to figure out how to select participants for Mount Sinai's proposed study given that SoCal Food Allergy's patient volume is typically much higher.

The two have not communicated since.

""The reviewers will say the same thing. They'll say, 'Well, we don't understand this concept. We don't understand the analytics,'"" Randhawa said.

Nadeau said she has contacted the Long Beach clinic several times to ask about patients who came to her because they were struggling at SoCal Food Allergy. ""I've tried to email him just to say, 'What are you guys doing? Can you please help me help your patients?' And nothing. Then I tried to call their office. Nothing,"" she said. ""We need help in taking care of their patients. We don't know what doses they run. Neither do the patients.""

In a field that requires collaboration to move forward, Illinois allergist Bajowala said it's hard to understand why ""there's such a veil of secrecy.""

Owing to his other responsibilities, Randhawa says he attends allergy and immunology conferences infrequently. He stays off OIT email lists and has steered clear of collaborations among allergists who collect and publish outcomes and best practices from food allergy immunotherapy in clinical practice. Securing interviews with Randhawa for this story required two months of discussion with the institute's media contact.

Still, Randhawa estimates that he has spoken to more than a hundred allergists about TIP in one way or another, including through conference presentations and medical school lectures he has given over the past decade. Several physicians from Southern California institutions came to the facility around a decade ago wanting to learn how things are done, he said. And once or twice a month Randhawa receives emails from curious allergists whose patients have come to SoCal. ""In the early years, they would just say, 'Oh he's just doing OIT,'"" Randhawa said. ""More recently, they just don't even know what it is. And they just say, 'it's different.'""

These days he's pushing on another front: getting the institute's tests and treatment covered by insurance and cleared by the FDA. The number of molecular markers analyzed in patient blood samples has risen from 70 to 80 a decade ago to more than 400 today, exceeding the capability of Quest Diagnostics. That forced SoCal Food Allergy to build its own testing facility.

Foundation Labs, the company Randhawa founded to do SoCal Food Allergy's testing, got certified by the accreditation organization COLA in 2019 — after massive delays and higher scrutiny stemming from fraudulent blood testing claims that had shut down the Silicon Valley startup Theranos the year before. As of fall 2019, ""Foundation Labs is still $3.5 million in debt,"" said Randhawa, who says he has purchased millions of dollars of equipment with his own money.

Randhawa said he will continue trying to publish SoCal Food Allergy's research. But the current system of peer review requires ""old forms of analysis,"" he said. ""I'm not trying to adapt to that. I'm here trying to do something innovative.""

""What you're really kind of boiling it down to is one word: disruption,"" he said. ""Am I trying to disrupt the system? Yes.""

33,"Doctors More Likely to Prescribe Opioids to COVID 'Long Haulers,' Raising Addiction Fears","Editor's note: Find the latest COVID-19 news and guidance in Medscape's Coronavirus Resource Center.

Covid survivors are at risk from a separate epidemic of opioid addiction, given the high rate of painkillers being prescribed to these patients, health experts say.

A new study in Nature found alarmingly high rates of opioid use among covid survivors with lingering symptoms at Veterans Health Administration facilities. About 10% of covid survivors develop ""long covid,"" struggling with often disabling health problems even six months or longer after a diagnosis.

For every 1,000 long-covid patients, known as ""long haulers,"" who were treated at a Veterans Affairs facility, doctors wrote nine more prescriptions for opioids than they otherwise would have, along with 22 additional prescriptions for benzodiazepines, which include Xanax and other addictive pills used to treat anxiety.

Although previous studies have found many covid survivors experience persistent health problems, the new article is the first to show they're using more addictive medications, said Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly, the paper's lead author.

He's concerned that even an apparently small increase in the inappropriate use of addictive pain pills will lead to a resurgence of the prescription opioid crisis, given the large number of covid survivors. More than 3 million of the 31 million Americans infected with covid develop long-term symptoms, which can include fatigue, shortness of breath, depression, anxiety and memory problems known as ""brain fog.""

The new study also found many patients have significant muscle and bone pain.

The frequent use of opioids was surprising, given concerns about their potential for addiction, said Al-Aly, chief of research and education service at the VA St. Louis Health Care System.

""Physicians now are supposed to shy away from prescribing opioids,"" said Al-Aly, who studied more than 73,000 patients in the VA system. When Al-Aly saw the number of opioids prescriptions, he said, he thought to himself, ""Is this really happening all over again?""

Doctors need to act now, before ""it's too late to do something,"" Al-Aly said. ""We must act now and ensure that people are getting the care they need. We do not want this to balloon into a suicide crisis or another opioid epidemic.""

As more doctors became aware of their addictive potential, new opioid prescriptions fell, by more than half since 2012. But U.S. doctors still prescribe far more of the drugs — which include OxyContin, Vicodin and codeine — than physicians in other countries, said Dr. Andrew Kolodny, medical director of opioid policy research at Brandeis University.

Some patients who became addicted to prescription painkillers switched to heroin, either because it was cheaper or because they could no longer obtain opioids from their doctors. Overdose deaths surged in recent years as drug dealers began spiking heroin with a powerful synthetic opioid called fentanyl.

More than 88,000 Americans died from overdoses during the 12 months ending in August 2020, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Health experts now advise doctors to avoid prescribing opioids for long periods.

The new study ""suggests to me that many clinicians still don't get it,"" Kolodny said. ""Many clinicians are under the false impression that opioids are appropriate for chronic pain patients.""

Hospitalized covid patients often receive a lot of medication to control pain and anxiety, especially in intensive care units, said Dr. Greg Martin, president of the Society of Critical Care Medicine. Patients placed on ventilators, for example, are often sedated to make them more comfortable.

Martin said he's concerned by the study's findings, which suggest patients are unnecessarily continuing medications after leaving the hospital.

""I worry that covid-19 patients, especially those who are severely and critically ill, receive a lot of medications during the hospitalization, and because they have persistent symptoms, the medications are continued after hospital discharge,"" Martin said.

While some covid patients are experiencing muscle and bone pain for the first time, others say the illness has intensified their preexisting pain.

Rachael Sunshine Burnett has suffered from chronic pain in her back and feet for 20 years, ever since an accident at a warehouse where she once worked. But Burnett, who first was diagnosed with covid in April 2020, said the pain soon became 10 times worse and spread to the area between her shoulders and spine. Although she was already taking long-acting OxyContin twice a day, her doctor prescribed an additional opioid called oxycodone, which relieves pain immediately. She was reinfected with covid in December.

""It's been a horrible, horrible year,"" said Burnett, 43, of Coxsackie, New York.

Doctors should recognize that pain can be a part of long covid, Martin said. ""We need to find the proper non-narcotic treatment for it, just like we do with other forms of chronic pain,"" he said.

The CDC recommends a number of alternatives to opioids — from physical therapy to biofeedback, over-the-counter anti-inflammatories, antidepressants and anti-seizure drugs that also relieve nerve pain.

The country also needs an overall strategy to cope with the wave of post-covid complications, Al-Aly said

""It's better to be prepared than to be caught off guard years from now, when doctors realize … 'Oh, we have a resurgence in opioids,'"" Al-Aly said.

Al-Aly noted that his study may not capture the full complexity of post-covid patient needs. Although women make up the majority of long-covid patients in most studies, most patients in the VA system are men.

The study of VA patients makes it ""abundantly clear that we are not prepared to meet the needs of 3 million Americans with long covid,"" said Dr. Eric Topol, founder and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute. ""We desperately need an intervention that will effectively treat these individuals.""

Al-Aly said covid survivors may need care for years.

""That's going to be a huge, significant burden on the health care system,"" Al-Aly said. ""Long covid will reverberate in the health system for years or even decades to come.""",www.medscape.com
34,Elsevier to Retract Debunked Masks Study,"Editor's note: Find the latest COVID-19 news and guidance in Medscape's Coronavirus Resource Center.

A study that warned of the perils of using face masks as a precaution against contracting Covid-19 appears slated for retraction, Retraction Watch has learned.

The 2020 paper, ""Facemasks in the COVID-19 era: A health hypothesis,"" was written by Baruch Vainshelboim, who listed his affiliation as Stanford University and the VA Palo Alto Health System. But the study gained wide circulation earlier this month, thanks in part to some conservative politicians, and became the subject of fact-checks by the Associated Press and Snopes, which pointed out that

The paper was published by an exercise physiologist with no academic connection to Stanford University or the NIH in a journal that accepts ""radical, speculative and non-mainstream scientific ideas.""

Among the claims in the article are that:

The existing scientific evidences challenge the safety and efficacy of wearing facemask as preventive intervention for COVID-19. The data suggest that both medical and non-medical facemasks are ineffective to block human-to-human transmission of viral and infectious disease such SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, supporting against the usage of facemasks.

Vainshelboim also argued that:

Wearing facemasks has been demonstrated to have substantial adverse physiological and psychological effects. These include hypoxia, hypercapnia, shortness of breath, increased acidity and toxicity, activation of fear and stress response, rise in stress hormones, immunosuppression, fatigue, headaches, decline in cognitive performance, predisposition for viral and infectious illnesses, chronic stress, anxiety and depression.

But Stanford disavowed Vainshelboim and his article in a statement:

Stanford Medicine strongly supports the use of face masks to control the spread of COVID-19. A study on the efficacy of face masks against COVID-19 published in the November 2020 issue of the journal Medical Hypotheses is not a ""Stanford study."" The author's affiliation is inaccurately attributed to Stanford, and we have requested a correction. The author, Baruch Vainshelboim, had no affiliation with the VA Palo Alto Health System or Stanford at the time of publication and has not had any affiliation since 2016, when his one-year term as a visiting scholar on matters unrelated to this paper ended.

A post on The Gateway Pundit which identified the study as related to Stanford has been updated.

Stanford isn't the only bogus credential Vainshelboim has used as an author. He often lists an affiliation with Rabin Medical Center, in Israel. However, according to an email we have seen from a faculty member at the institution, Vainshelboim has not been on staff there for at least eight years and never held a professorship, as he has claimed in biographies.

In his 2019 article, ""Physiological Responses and Prognostic Value of Common Exercise Testing Modalities in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis,"" Vainshelboim has three institiontional affiliations: Stanford, Rabin Medical Center and the School of Health Sciences at Saint Francis University, in Loretto, Pa. (The official title is the School of Health Sciences & Education.) That last one does appear to be true, according to this 2019 press release. However, the dean's office for the school told us that Vainshelboim is no longer with the university. Donald Walkovich, the dean of the School of Health Sciences & Education, confirmed that Vainshelboim worked there between August 2017 and May 2019, but would not discuss the reason for his departure.

Vainshelboim's arrival at Saint Francis was profiled in this brief 2017 news article, which noted that he had:

more than 10 years of clinical experience in cardiopulmonary rehabilitation and exercise testing where he served as in-charge exercise physiologist of the cardiac rehabilitation program at Wingate College, Israel, and as a clinical exercise researcher for cardiopulmonary exercise testing and pulmonary rehabilitation at the Rabin Medical Center, Israel.

Those details don't seem to jibe with what's on Vainshelboim's LinkedIn page, which says he received a PhD in exercise physiology from the University of Porto in 2014 and a master's degree from Wingate in 2008.

Vainshelboim did not respond to a request for comment.

35,Montana Bill Aims to Stop Work Bias Based on Vaccine Status,"Editor's note: Find the latest COVID-19 news and guidance in Medscape's Coronavirus Resource Center.

HELENA, Mont. (AP) — Montana's Legislature has passed a bill that would prohibit employers from requiring vaccinations as a condition of employment — a measure that could block a Great Falls health system from requiring its employees to get COVID-19 shots.

The bill makes it an unlawful discriminatory practice for a person or governmental entity to deny services, goods, privileges, licensing, educational opportunities or employment opportunities based on vaccination status or whether someone has an immunity passport.

It passed the House on Monday and now goes to Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte for consideration. He has not said if he will sign the measure.

Supporters of the bill include some employees of Benefis Health System in Great Falls, who were told they would have to get COVID-19 vaccinations to continue working.

""Currently, there's no Montana state law allowing employers to require vaccines as a condition of employment because up to now Montana employers have respected the fundamental, personal, medical and religious freedoms of Montanans,"" Republican Sen. Tom McGillvray of Billings said last week in presenting the bill in the Senate.

""However, that's not the case anymore,"" he said. ""There are employers ... that are requiring and coercing employees to get vaccinations under threat of termination and intimidation.""

The bill still allows employers to strongly recommend vaccinations and ""does not in any way prevent any employer from taking reasonable safety precautions, just as any hospital currently does, with an employee who does not have a flu shot,"" the bill's sponsor, Republican Rep. Jennifer Carlson of Manhattan, said Monday.

Under the bill, employers would not be allowed to require employees to receive vaccinations that are being distributed under emergency use authorization, under which the Food and Drug Administration has authorized COVID-19 shots to be administered.

Whitney Bania, a spokesperson for Benefis Health System, declined to comment on the bill's passage by the Legislature.

Healthcare organizations were concerned about language in the bill that says employers can't discriminate against a person in a term, condition or privilege of employment based on vaccination status.

The Montana Hospital Association and other healthcare organizations interpreted that to mean they couldn't take precautions such as requiring an unvaccinated employee to wear a mask, and would thus have to treat every employee as if they were not vaccinated. That would lead to visitation restrictions, the groups said.

""The language of the bill, as written, will prevent healthcare facilities from screening potential employees in the hiring process without violating the newly created discrimination provisions in the bill,"" the Montana Hospital Association said Tuesday.

The association also believes the bill would prohibit medical facilities from requiring vaccinations for employees who have direct contact with patients and the public.

Republican Rep. Llew Jones of Conrad said he, too, was concerned about the bill until he spoke with Carlson, Lt. Gov. Kristen Juras and the chief executive officer of the Northern Rockies Medical Center in Cut Bank and received assurances the bill would not cause visitation limits at hospitals and nursing homes.

""We have not had that communication and we do see the bill differently,"" Katy Peterson, spokesperson for the Montana Hospital Association, said after the bill passed the House on its final reading.

The association is consulting with attorneys.

""It is our goal to identify the necessary steps to remain in compliance with all applicable state and federal laws while mitigating any negative impacts on patient and staff safety,"" the MHA said in a statement.

Hospital officials argue the bill goes beyond addressing objections to COVID-19 vaccinations.

The bill ""unravels more than 50 years of medical science and expert guidance in protecting patients and healthcare workers from infectious diseases,"" Rich Rasmussen, president and CEO of the Montana Hospital Association, told reporters.

The health organizations had hoped the bill would be amended to address only concerns about COVID-19 vaccination requirements.

An amendment does clarify that the bill does not affect vaccine requirements at schools and daycare facilities, where people can seek religious or medical exemptions to vaccinations.",www.medscape.com
36,Pandemic Imperiled Non-English Speakers More Than Others,"Editor's note: Find the latest COVID-19 news and guidance in Medscape's Coronavirus Resource Center.

In March 2020, just weeks into the covid-19 pandemic, the incident command center at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston was scrambling to understand this deadly new disease. It appeared to be killing more Black and brown patients than whites. For Latinos, there was an additional warning sign: language.

Patients who didn't speak much, or any, English had a 35% greater chance of death.

Clinicians who couldn't communicate clearly with patients in the hospital's covid units noticed it was affecting outcomes.

""We had an inkling that language was going to be an issue early on,"" said Dr. Karthik Sivashanker, then Brigham's medical director for quality, safety and equity. ""We were getting safety reports saying language is a problem.""

Sivashanker dived into the records, isolating and layering the unique characteristics of each of the patients who died: their race, age and sex and whether they spoke English.

""That's where we started to really discover some deeper, previously invisible inequities,"" he said.

Inequities that weren't about race alone.

Hospitals across the country have reported more hospitalizations and deaths of Black and Latino patients than of whites. Black and brown patients may be more susceptible because they are more likely to have a chronic illness that increases the risk of serious covid. But when the Brigham team compared Black and brown patients with white patients who had similar chronic illnesses, they found no difference in the risk of death from covid.

But a difference did emerge for Latino patients who don't speak English. That sobering realization helped them home in on a specific health disparity, think about some possible solutions and begin a commitment to change.

""That's the future,"" said Sivashanker.

Identifying the Risk

But first, Brigham had to unravel this latest example of a life-threatening health disparity. It started outside the hospital, in lower-income communities in and just outside Boston, where the coronavirus spread quickly among many native Spanish speakers who live in close quarters with jobs they can't do from home.

Some avoided coming to the hospital until they were very sick, because they didn't trust the care in big hospitals or feared detection by immigration authorities. Nevertheless, just weeks into the pandemic, covid patients who spoke little English began surging into Boston hospitals, including Brigham and Women's.

""We were, frankly, not fully prepared for that surge,"" said Sivashanker. ""We have really amazing interpreter services, but they were starting to get overwhelmed.""

""In the beginning, we didn't know how to act. We were panicking,"" said Ana Maria Rios-Velez, a Spanish-language interpreter at Brigham.

Rios-Velez remembered searching for words to translate this new disease and experience for patients. When called to a covid patient's room, interpreters were confused about whether they could go in and how close they should get to a patient. Some interpreters said they felt disposable in the early days of the pandemic, when they weren't given adequate personal protective equipment.

When she had PPE, Rios-Velez said, she still struggled to gain a patient's trust from behind a mask, face shield and gown. For safety, many interpreters were urged to work from home. But speaking to patients over the phone created new problems.

""It was extremely difficult, extremely difficult,"" she said. ""The patients were having breathing issues. They were coughing. Their voices were muffled.""

And Rios-Velez couldn't look her patients in the eye to put them at ease and build a connection.

""It's not only the voice. Sometimes I need to see the lips, if smiling,"" she said. ""I want them to see the compassion in me.""

Adding Interpreters and Tech

Brigham responded by adding more interpreters and buying more iPads so remote workers could see patients. The hospital purchased amplifiers to raise the volume of patients' voices above the beeps and machines humming in an ICU. The Mass General Brigham network is piloting the use of interpreters available via video in primary care offices. A study found Spanish-speaking patients used telemedicine less than white patients during the pandemic.

Brigham's goal is that every patient who needs an interpreter will get one. Sivashanker said that happens now for most patients who make the request. The bigger challenge, he said, is including an interpreter in the care of patients who may need the help but don't ask for it.

In the first surge, interpreters also became translators for the hospital's website, information kiosks, covid safety signs and brochures.

""It was really tough. I got sick and had to take a week off,"" said Yilu Ma, Brigham's director of interpreter services. Mass General Brigham is now expanding a centralized translation service for the entire hospital network.

Inequities Within the Hospital Workforce

Brigham and Women's analytics team uncovered other disparities. Lower-paid employees were getting covid more often than nurses and doctors. Sivashanker said there were dozens of small group meetings with medical assistants, transport workers, security staffers and those in environmental services in which he shared the higher positive test rates and encouraged everyone to get tested.

""We let them know they wouldn't lose their jobs"" if they had to miss work, Sivashanker said. And he, along with managers, told these employees ""that we realize you're risking your life just like any other doctor of nurse is, every single day you come to work.""

Some employees complained of favoritism in the distribution of PPE, which the hospital investigated. To make sure all employees were receiving timely updates as pandemic guidance changed, Brigham started translating all coronavirus messages into Spanish and other languages and sending them via text, which people who are on the move all day are more likely to read. The Mass General Brigham system offered hardship grants of up to $1,000 for employees with added financial pressures, such as additional child care costs.

Angelina German, a hospital housekeeper with limited English, said she appreciates getting updates via text in Spanish, as well as in-person covid briefings from her bosses.

""Now they're more aware of us all,"" German said through an interpreter, ""making sure people are taking care of themselves.""

Beyond the Hospital Walls

The hospital also set up testing sites in some Boston neighborhoods with high coronavirus infection rates, including neighborhoods where many employees live and were getting infected. At least one of those sites now offers covid vaccinations.

""No one has to be scheduled. You don't need insurance. You just walk up and we can test you,"" Dr. Christin Price explained during a visit last fall to a testing site in the Jamaica Plain neighborhood.

Nancy Santiago left the testing site carrying a free 10-pound bag of fruits and vegetables, which she'll share with her mother. Santiago said she's grateful for the help.

""I had to leave my job because of [lack of] day care, and it's been pretty tough,"" she said. ""But, you know, we gotta keep staying strong, and hopefully this is over sooner rather than later.""

Brigham recently opened a similar indoor operation at the Strand Theatre in the Dorchester neighborhood. Everyone who comes for a coronavirus test is asked if they have enough to eat, if they can afford their medications, if they need housing assistance and if they're registered to vote.

Mass General Brigham leaders said they'll take what they've learned dissecting disparities during the pandemic and expand the remedies across the hospital network.

""Many of the issues that were identified during the covid equity response are unfortunately pretty universal issues that we need to address, if we're going to be an anti-racist organization,"" said Tom Sequist, chief of patient experience and equity for Mass General Brigham.

Brigham's work on health disparities comes, in part, out of a collaboration with the Institute for Healthcare Improvement.

""There's a lot of defensive routines into which we slip as clinicians that the data can help cut through and reveal that there are some biases in your own practice,"" explained IHI President and CEO Dr. Kedar Mate.

""If we don't name and start to talk about racism and how we intend to dismantle it or undo it,"" Mate added, ""we'll continue to place Band-Aids on the problem and not actually tackle the underlying causes.""

""Poverty and social determinants of health needs are not going away any time soon, and so if there's a way to continue to serve the communities, I think that would be tremendous,"" said Price, who helped organize Brigham's testing program.

But has Brigham's work lowered the risk of death from covid for Spanish-speaking patients? The hospital hasn't updated the analysis yet, and even when it does, determining whether (or how) the interventions worked will be hard, Sivashanker said.

""It's never going to be as simple as 'We just didn't give them enough iPads or translators and that was the only problem,'"" said Sivashanker.

But Sivashanker said more interpreters and iPads, and better messaging to non-English speaking employees — plus all the other steps Brigham has taken during the pandemic — have improved both the patient and the employee experience. That, he said, counts as a success, while work on the next layer of discrimination continues.

37,"Pfizer Pill for COVID Could Be Ready by End of Year, CEO Says","Editor's note: Find the latest COVID-19 news and guidance in Medscape's Coronavirus Resource Center.

Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla says an oral drug the company is developing to treat COVID-19 symptoms could be available to the public by the end of the year.

""If all goes well, and we implement the same speed that we are, and if regulators do the same, and they are, I hope that (it will be available) by the end of the year,"" Bourla said on CNBC's Squawk Box.

So far, the only anti-viral drug authorized for use with COVID-19 is Remdesivir, which is produced by Gilead Sciences and must be administered by injection in a health care setting.

An oral drug like the one Pfizer is developing could be taken at home and might keep people out of the hospital.

""Particular attention is on the oral because it provides several advantages,"" Bourla said. ""One of them is that you don't need to go to the hospital to get the treatment, which is the case with all the injectables so far. You could get it at home, and that could be a game-changer.""

The drug might be effective against the emerging variants, he said. Pfizer is also working on an injectable anti-viral drug.

Pfizer, with its European partner BioNTech, developed the first coronavirus vaccine authorized for use in the United States and Europe. The Pfizer pill under development would not be a vaccine to protect people from the virus but a drug to treat people who catch the virus.

The company announced in late March that it was starting clinical trials on the oral drug.

In a news release, the company said the oral drug would work by blocking protease, a critical enzyme that the virus needs to replicate. Protease inhibitors are used in medicines to treat HIV and hepatitis C.

A coronavirus vaccine that could be taken as a pill may enter clinical trials in the second quarter of 2021. The oral vaccine is being developed by Oravax Medical, a new joint venture of the Israeli-American company Oramed and the Indian company Premas Biotech. So far, all coronavirus vaccines are injectable.

38,FDA Panel Backs Atezolizumab for mTNBC -- at Least for Now,"On the first day of a historic three-day meeting into cancer indications that were granted an accelerated approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the first one to come under discussion is staying in place, at least for now.

Members of the FDA's Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) voted 7-2 in favor of keeping in place the indication for atezolizumab (Tecentriq) for use in a certain form of breast cancer, and at the same time urging the manufacturer, Genentech, to do the research needed to prove the medicine works for these patients.

The specific indication is for atezolizumab use as part of a combination with nab-paclitaxel for patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) whose tumors are PD-L1+.

The FDA granted a conditional clearance known as an accelerated approval in 2019 for this use of atezolizumab, expecting Genentech to produce more extensive evidence of this benefit. But so far, Genentech has not produced the data proving to the FDA that atezolizumab provides the expected benefit.

The drug was already available for use in bladder cancer, having been granted a full approval for this indication in 2016.

Other Accelerated Approvals Withdrawn

This week's three-day ODAC meeting is part of the FDA's broader reconsideration of what it has described as ""dangling accelerated approvals.""

Earlier discussion between the FDA and drugmakers have already triggered four voluntary withdrawals of cancer indications with these accelerated approvals, noted Julia A. Beaver, MD, and Richard Pazdur, MD, two of the FDA's top regulators of oncology medicine, in an April 21 perspective article in the New England Journal of Medicine.

""The small percentage of drugs whose clinical benefit is ultimately not confirmed should be viewed not as a failure of accelerated approval but rather as an expected trade-off in expediting drug development that benefits patients with severe or life-threatening diseases,"" Beaver and Pazdur write.

But making these calls can be tough. On the first day of the meeting, even ODAC panelists who backed Genentech's bid to maintain an mTNBC indication for atezolizumab expressed discomfort with this choice.

The FDA granted the accelerated approval for use of this drug in March 2019 based upon improved progression-free survival from the IMpassion130 trial. But the drug fell short in subsequent efforts to confirm the results seen in that study. The confirmatory IMpassion131 trial failed to meet the primary endpoint, the FDA staff noted in briefing materials for the ODAC meeting.

ODAC panelist Stan Lipkowitz, MD, PhD, of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), said he expected this vote had been a tough one for all members serving on ODAC that day.

""In some ways, the purist in me said I should have voted no. But when I looked at the data, there are a couple of things that struck me,"" said Lipkowitz, who is the chief of the Women's Malignancies Branch at NCI's Center for Cancer Research. “First of all the landscape hasn't changed. There's really no therapy in the first line for triple-negative metastatic that is shown to improve survival.”

Lipkowitz emphasized that Genentech needs to continue to try to prove atezolizumab works in this setting.

""There needs to be confirmatory study,"" Lipkowitz concluded.

ODAC panelist Matthew Ellis, MD, PhD, of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, said he also understood the difficult outlook for women fighting this cancer, but he voted against maintaining the approval.

""It's not that I don't feel the tragedy of these women,"" said Ellis, citing his own decades of clinical experience.

""I just think that the data are the data,"" Ellis said, adding that in his view, the ""the only correct interpretation"" of the evidence supported a vote against allowing the indication to stay.

The FDA considers the recommendations of its advisory committees, but is not bound by them.

In a statement issued after the vote, Genentech said it intends to work with the FDA to determine the next steps for this indication of atezolizumab because ""the clinically meaningful benefit demonstrated in the IMpassion130 study remains.""

The ODAC meeting continues for 2 more days, and will consider five more cancer indications that have been granted an accelerated approval.

39,Outdoor Mask Guidance Echoes What Many Americans Already Do,"Editor's note: Find the latest COVID-19 news and guidance in Medscape's Coronavirus Resource Center.

In the small Nebraska town of Oxford, the school district dropped its mask mandate last month in what was a fairly straight-forward decision: Cases were down dramatically, and it didn't bother local officials that their move flouted Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines.

Those federal mask guidelines just didn't seem to fit local conditions well in the town of about 800 people where hardly anyone wears a mask.

""We haven't paid a whole lot of attention to what is going on at the federal level — mainly what is coming out through the state,"" Southern Valley Superintendent Bryce Jorgensen said. ""You just can't compare Chicago to Oxford, Nebraska. Things are just different.""

On Tuesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention eased its guidelines on the wearing of masks outdoors, saying fully vaccinated Americans don't need to cover their faces anymore unless they are in a big crowd of strangers. And those who are unvaccinated can go outside without masks in some situations, too.

For most of the past year, the CDC had been advising Americans to wear masks outdoors if they are within 6 feet of one another.

The decision marked the U.S. government's latest step toward normalcy, but came as much of the country already had moved on from mask rules. The CDC essentially endorsed what many Americans have already been doing.

On the same day the CDC updated its guidance, Louisiana's governor partially lifted the state's mask mandate, the first Democratic governor to make such a move during Joe Biden's presidency. Elsewhere, local government leaders have been doing away with mask rules, and in many states, face coverings are an infrequent sight indoors, let alone outside.

In Montgomery, Alabama, 73-year-old Judy Adams said she hasn't worn a mask outside since the early days of the pandemic a year ago and only puts them on inside when stores mandate them. Alabama had a statewide mask mandate until earlier this month, when the governor let it expire.

""I think it's ridiculous, because it's not helping,"" she said of mask rules. ""This is about control and fear. It ain't about nothing but control and fear.""

Since the start of the pandemic, the federal government has struggled to accomplish consistency in public health measures from state to state. The CDC has issued guidelines on masks, social distancing, travel and other activities but it's up to governors on whether to adhere to the measures. Some states never had mask mandates, while others still have them on the books.

""Today, I hope, is a day when we can take another step back to the normalcy of before,"" CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said Tuesday. ""Over the past year, we have spent a lot of time telling Americans what you can't do. Today, I am going to tell you some of the things you can do, if you are fully vaccinated.""

The CDC says that, whether they are fully vaccinated or not, people do not have to wear masks outdoors when they walk, bike or run alone or with members of their household. An unvaccinated person can also go maskless to a small outdoor gathering with fully vaccinated people.

But unvaccinated people — defined as those who have yet to receive both doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine or the one-shot Johnson & Johnson formula — should wear masks at small outdoor gatherings that include other unvaccinated people, the CDC says. They also should keep their faces covered when dining at outdoor restaurants with friends from multiple households.

And everyone, fully vaccinated or not, should keep wearing masks at crowded outdoor events such as concerts or sporting events, the CDC says.

The agency continues to recommend masks at indoor public places, such as hair salons, restaurants, shopping centers, gyms, museums and movie theaters, saying that is still the safer course even for vaccinated people.

The change comes as more than half of U.S. adults — or about 140 million people — have received at least one dose of vaccine, and more than a third have been fully vaccinated.

Walensky said the decision was driven by rising vaccination numbers; declines in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths; and research showing that less than 10% of documented instances of transmission of the virus happened outdoors.

The new guidance represents another carefully calibrated step on the road back to normal from the coronavirus outbreak that has killed over 570,000 people in U.S.

In Plano, Texas, Rob Webster, a 49-year-old church employee, said the new guidelines sound ""reasonable"" but he has some reservations.

""My only concern is that there are so many people who want to buck the system anyway,"" said Webster, communications director at Custer Road United Methodist Church, which requires masks on church property, including for outdoor youth group meetings.

""So I don't know if I was around a group of people who weren't wearing masks, are they really vaccinated? ... It makes me maybe a little more fearful and less trusting of the people around me.""

In the Nebraska school district, Superintendent Jorgensen said the district decided to eliminate its mask rule based on conditions in the area and in the state, which never had a statewide mask mandate.

The district did see an elevated risk of the virus last fall when cases statewide were peaking, but there hasn't been a single case in the district since January and fewer than a dozen cases had been reported in the two counties around the district when they made the decision.

Jorgensen said the district is still being careful and will require students to quarantine for 10 days if they test positive for the virus, but the mask mandate didn't seem necessary anymore.

""It's not like we've totally thrown everything out the window. We still are closely watching it and monitoring every situation we can. But it just seems that those seem a little bit extreme,"" Jorgensen said of the federal mask recommendations. ""I think we have people here who can make some good local decisions, so that's why we did it the way we did it.""

40,Pooled Testing Gets Smarter During the Pandemic,"Editor's note: Find the latest COVID-19 news and guidance in Medscape's Coronavirus Resource Center.

More than a year into the COVID-19 pandemic, efficient testing for the coronavirus remains relevant as variants spread and vaccinations have been slow to roll out in many parts of the world. That is why some academic groups and companies have been using a combination of math and artificial intelligence to improve pooled testing, which began as a proposal to screen the US military for syphilis during World War II, and has since been used for blood donations and to conserve sometimes scarce testing supplies in HIV surveillance.

Pooled testing for COVID-19 enables such efficiency by taking the diluted samples from nasal swabs of two or more people and screening all the samples together using a single test kit. If the pool comes back negative, then every sample included in the pool can be assumed to be negative. If the pool comes back positive, the lab must usually go back and retest each sample individually to figure out who is infected.

At first glance, pooled testing seems like a no-brainer during a pandemic. Getting more tests done with fewer supplies could prove handy — for instance, at times like last January, when more than half of labs surveyed in the United States still reported testing supply shortages. Pooled testing could also make mass testing faster — China has already used it to screen millions of people during smaller COVID-19 outbreaks. But pooled testing's efficiency drops off significantly as positivity rates rise and there are more contaminated pools.

One way around that may be to use what some researchers call smart pooled testing, which uses mathematically sophisticated techniques — sometimes augmented by artificial intelligence — to boost the efficiency of pooled testing. Many research groups around the world have published papers about how such smart pooling can identify those likely to be infected to reduce the number of positive pools and potentially even sidestep the need for retesting altogether. But most labs still don't use pooled testing, let alone smart pooled testing.

The story is different in Israel, where several labs began using smart pooled testing based on both mathematical and AI techniques last winter. The mathematical technique was developed by Israeli researchers just several weeks after the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic in March 2020. By spreading individual samples across multiple pools to create unique combinations, the researchers showed they could identify positive samples by simply comparing the pattern of the positive pools.

Turning that academic exercise into something that labs would adopt was another matter. ""We already had proof-of-concept data that this is useful,"" says Tomer Hertz, a computational immunologist at Ben-Gurion University in Israel. ""But to get to a point where a lab is actually going to run what we're doing took about nine months.""

One commercial lab operated by the biotech company Ilex Medical has since been using this combinatorial pooling approach to reduce the need for individual retesting. Two other labs operated by Clalit Health Services, Israel's largest state-mandated health maintenance organization, are also using it together with an AI pre-screening technique that helps to prevent high-risk samples from contaminating the pools. Altogether, six robots programmed to implement the pooling strategy are helping them process up to 7,000 tests each day in Israel and more than 400,000 tests had been performed by mid-April.

Such operations could yield useful lessons for many countries — including the US, where some labs have used standard pooling, and Colombia, where a homegrown smart pooling effort is looking to take hold — in dealing with both COVID-19 and future pandemics.

Most labs haven't tried standard pooled testing because of the limiting factors that can reduce pooling's effectiveness. For example, large pool sizes can dilute the amount of virus to the point that it is undetectable. Pooled testing also becomes less efficient as the percentage of infected people in a population increases because more positive samples typically lead to more retesting. The high positivity rates across much of the country have been one reason why major American testing companies such as Quest Diagnostics have limited pooled testing.

""Every lab needs to do its own validation study for pooling because it really depends on the prevalence rate of COVID-19 in that specific region,"" says Baha Abdalhamid, a physician and assistant director of the Nebraska Public Health Laboratory. In April 2020, Abdalhamid and colleagues at the University of Nebraska published the results of a proof-of-concept study in the American Journal of Clinical Pathology that showed how even a standard pooled testing approach could be cost-effective at COVID-19 positivity rates of 10% or less.

Some places have made standard pooled testing work. Last year, administrators at Saratoga Hospital in New York used rapid COVID-19 testing to screen everyone who was admitted to the hospital regardless of their health condition. But screening every incoming patient strained the hospital's testing supplies at a time of nationwide shortages, so the hospital began pooling two or three samples at a time in April of last year, eventually expanding to pools of five. The hospital also relied on emergency room physicians to determine which incoming patients were more or less likely to have the disease, which helped to create pools with samples likely to test negative.

""It was very successful and it allowed us to rapidly test everyone being admitted to the hospital,"" says David Mastrianni, a hematology specialist and oncologist at Saratoga Hospital. ""We never would have been able to do it without the pooling.""

This worked while the COVID-19 positivity rate remained low among incoming patients. But when positivity rates began rising in the fall of 2020, Saratoga Hospital's strategy fell apart; too many pools ended up with positive cases because physicians had relaxed their criteria for putting patient samples into pools over the summer. The hospital tightened up criteria once again and started preliminary screening with an even faster, though less accurate, form of rapid testing to help sort samples into low-risk pools for the main testing effort. Today, despite another recent uptick in the positivity rate in the community, the hospital is seeing fewer admissions, so they have dropped pre-screening and are now testing their low-risk samples in pools of two.

In comparison, the smart pooled testing strategies developed in Israel can boost efficiency in several ways. For instance, the Israeli researchers who successfully deployed smart pooling — organized under a startup called Poold Diagnostics — showed that their combinatorial approach was able to identify four people infected with COVID-19 out of a total of 384 samples, according to results published in Science Advances last summer. They did this by distributing each sample into six different pools to create 48 pools of 48 samples each. The cost of screening 384 people individually would be about $20,000 with standard testing at $50 per test; the pooled strategy cut that to approximately $2,500.

But the rate of positive COVID-19 in the broader population was just around 1% for the study, which is likely one reason why the results were so successful. The approach would still work around the ""break-even point"" of a positivity rate around 10%, says Noam Shental, a computational biologist at the Open University of Israel and cofounder of Poold Diagnostics. Any higher than that, though, and there would be too many contaminated pools for it to be cost effective.

This is where AI can seemingly squeeze out even more efficiency. Poold Diagnostics teamed up with the company Neura, which has developed an AI model to help predict and monitor the spread of COVID-19 cases. Neura uses an AI technique called machine learning to train a model on large amounts of behavioral and epidemiological data related to COVID-19 so that it can then automatically identify hidden patterns.

The data analyzed by Neura's AI includes dozens of indicators relevant to COVID-19, such as recent travel from communities with high levels of COVID-19 and adherence to social distancing guidelines. The data, provided by Israel's universal healthcare system, are anonymized.

The model was first created in March 2020 ""and has been updating since then,"" says Amit Hammer, Neura's CEO. ""And this model works at the country level and the county level, the city level, and even at the neighborhood level.""

For the smart pooled testing, Neura's AI analyzes the anonymized data for new samples and assigns a risk score reflecting the probability that it will be positive or negative. A risk score of zero means a sample is highly likely to be negative, whereas a sample with a risk score of 100 is highly likely to be positive, Hammer explains.

The risk scores help labs understand which samples should undergo individual testing rather than pooled testing. And that keeps the pooled testing efficient even in circumstances when the positivity rate among the incoming samples may be relatively high.

When the positivity rate in Israel was around 8.6% in August of last year, Neura's risk scoring approach was able to help create pools with positivity rates of 2% or less during preliminary trial runs. More recently, Neura's approach has helped labs to screen up to 50,000 samples per day to optimize both individual testing and pooled testing. This AI screening can keep pools at about 2% positivity despite higher community positivity rates of 20% or 25%, Hammer says.

But Hammer cautions that, in order to maintain this efficiency, the AI models need to be updated constantly and quickly as COVID-19 prevalence changes in the populations being tested.

""The key is to have good predictor variables, like type of symptoms or exposure to other infected individuals,"" says Christopher Bilder, a statistician at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, who has studied how to optimize pooled testing but was not involved in the efforts in Israel.

In theory, any method that perfectly predicted who would test positive for COVID-19 could completely replace testing. But AI models don't work well enough to do that, especially given the potential impact of false positives or false negatives on life-or-death health decisions. Even the best AI models must strike a balance involving the inherent tradeoff between producing either more false positives or more false negatives.

""At the beginning of the pandemic, I observed there were a lot of projects aiming at using AI for COVID-19 screening with claims of it being faster and easier than using standard testing,"" says Maria Camila Escobar, a biomedical engineer at the University of the Andes in Colombia. She described the idea of an AI-only approach as ""irresponsible.""

By contrast, using AI in combination with pooled testing provides a fallback in case the AI predictions are inaccurate. At worst, inaccurate AI predictions may lead to mixing more positive results in with largely negative pools, which would force labs to spend more time and resources retesting people. ""Yeah, you lose a couple of tests, but you don't lose the lives of people that you're telling to go outside, and they actually have COVID, and your model failed,"" Escobar says.

Using samples and anonymized data collected by testing centers in Bogota, Colombia's capital city, Escobar and colleagues showed how machine learning could enable efficient smart pooling with simulated COVID-19 positivity rates of up to 25%, as detailed in a paper the group posted last summer, which has not yet been peer reviewed. The researchers also conducted a separate pilot study with the Covida project, a university-associated testing effort that actively screens for COVID-19 cases in Bogota. That pilot study helped save more than 2,000 test kits using pool sizes of just two samples each.

Although the work is preliminary, Covida has already received half a million dollars in funding from the Rockefeller Foundation to deploy it more broadly in Colombia. ""Considering the fact that it seemed like an innovative approach to increase testing capacity and efficiency, these early results made it particularly interesting,"" says Greg Kuzmak, a manager with the Health Initiative at the Rockefeller Foundation. ""Because perhaps there's some catalytic capital we could provide that would allow this to expand and scale across the city of Bogota.""

With the Rockefeller Foundation's backing, the University of the Andes team is working with Bogota's health department to roll out smart pooling in every official testing center in the coming weeks. By the end of this year, the team hopes to have scaled up smart pooling across the entire city, which is also responsible for much of the COVID-19 lab testing in Colombia.

The University of the Andes team initially explored more mathematically complicated pooling schemes like the Israeli group's approach. But local labs balked at the prospect of having to rearrange their workflow, especially in the absence of equipment necessary for handling more complex testing procedures — an issue that could hinder adoption of more complex pooled testing strategies in many places around the world.

Another challenge is having access to the health and other data that AI models need for their predictions. While Poold Diagnostics has ready access to such data through its partnership with Israel's health care system, the University of the Andes team encountered labs in Colombia that only had the relevant data stored as scanned PDF files, which made it difficult to extract and analyze the necessary information. That has delayed the smart pooling rollout until the city of Bogota completes a new digital health system that will allow testing facilities to swiftly upload the relevant information to a central online database.

As year two of the pandemic continues, Poold Diagnostics and Neura are both seeking partners and regulatory approval to expand in the US and Europe, while the University of the Andes team has discussed supporting pooled testing in countries such as Gambia. But the future of smart pooling will also depend on how easily labs can adopt it without complicating existing operations.

""I don't know if machine learning would have helped us, or could help us in the future, with our pooled strategy,"" says Mastrianni at Saratoga Hospital in New York. ""The mix of science, logistics, supply lines, and politics changes pretty fast and sometimes seems random.""

The simplest pooling strategies still clearly have their uses, says Moran Yassour, a computational biologist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. As a computer scientist, she acknowledges the allure of playing with ""fancier models of pooling."" But from a practical standpoint, she says, overworked labs want consistent procedures to interpret and implement.

Without using AI or smart pooling, Yassour and her colleagues screened almost 134,000 samples using just under 18,000 pools at Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem over a five-month period. This used just 24% of the tests that would have normally been required, as detailed in a paper published recently in Science Translational Medicine.

This simple strategy created pools based on whatever samples came into the lab together at the same time to take advantage of how samples were often collected all together from people in places where clusters of COVID-19 cases had occurred. That meant positive samples often ended up together in the same few pools, rather than showing up across many pools.

Such an approach held up while positivity rates among the Israeli samples fluctuated between less than 1% and 6%. Other situations involving higher positivity rates may benefit from the smart pooling schemes. But at the very least, there seems to be a growing body of evidence suggesting more labs could benefit from dipping their toes into pooling, Yassour says.

""We're trying to spread the word of how a very simplistic pooling scheme can go a very long way,"" she adds.",www.medscape.com
41,Hyperprogression on Immunotherapy: When Outcomes Are Much Worse,"Immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors has ushered in a new era of cancer therapy, with some patients showing dramatic responses and significantly better outcomes than with other therapies across many cancer types.

But some patients do worse, sometimes much worse.

A subset of patients who undergo immunotherapy experience unexpected, rapid disease progression, with a dramatic acceleration of disease trajectory. They also have a shorter progression-free survival and overall survival than would have been expected.

This has been described as hyperprogression and has been termed ""hyperprogressive disease"" (HPD).

It has been seen in a variety of cancers; the incidence ranges from 4% to 29% in the studies reported to date.

There has been some debate over whether this is a real phenomenon or whether it is part of the natural course of disease.

HPD is a ""provocative phenomenon,"" comment the authors of a recent commentary entitled ""Hyperprogresssion and Immunotherapy: Fact, Fiction, or Alternative Fact?""

""This phenomenon has polarized oncologists who debate that this could still reflect the natural history of the disease,"" says the author of another commentary.

Dr Kartik Sehgal

But the tide is now turning toward acceptance of HPD, says Kartik Sehgal, MD, oncologist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard University, Boston, Massachusetts.

""With publication of multiple clinical reports of different cancer types worldwide, hyperprogression is now accepted by most oncologists to be a true phenomenon rather than natural progression of disease,"" says Sehgal.

He authored an invited commentary in JAMA Network Open about one of the latest meta-analyses to investigate HPD during immunotherapy. One of the biggest issues is that the studies that have reported on HPD have been retrospective, with a lack of comparator groups and a lack of a standardized definition of hyperprogression. He emphasizes the need to study hyperprogression in well-designed prospective studies.

Existing Data on HPD

HPD was described as ""a new pattern of progression"" seen in patients undergoing immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy in a 2017 article published in Clinical Cancer Research. Authors Stephane Champiat, MD, PhD, of Institut Gustave Roussy, Universite Paris Saclay, Villejuif, France, and colleagues cited ""anecdotal occurrences"" of HPD among patients in phase 1 trials of anti–programmed cell death protein–1/programmed cell death–ligand-1 (PD-1/PD-L1) agents.

In that study, HPD was defined by tumor growth rate ratio. The incidence was 9% among 213 patients.

The findings raised concerns about treating elderly patients with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monotherapy, according to the authors, who called for further study.

That same year, Roberto Ferrara, MD, and colleagues from the Insitut Gustave Roussy reported additional data indicating an incidence of HPD of 16% among 333 patients with non–small cell lung cancer who underwent immunotherapy at eight centers from 2012 to 2017. The findings, which were presented at the 2017 World Conference on Lung Cancer and were reported at the time by Medscape Medical News, also showed that the incidence of HPD was higher with immunotherapy than with single-agent chemotherapy (5%).

Median overall survival (OS) was just 3.4 months among those with HPD, compared with 13 months in the overall study population ― worse, even, than the median 5.4-month OS observed among patients with progressive disease who received immunotherapy.

In the wake of these findings, numerous researchers have attempted to better define HPD, its incidence, and patient factors associated with developing HPD while undergoing immunotherapy.

Dr Vivek Subbiah

However, there is little so far to show for those effort, Vivek Subbiah, MD, of MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, said in an interview.

""Many questions remain to be answered,"" said Subbiah, clinical medical director of the Clinical Center for Targeted Therapy in the Division of Cancer Medicine at MD Anderson. He was the senior author of the ""Fact, Fiction or Alternative Fact?"" commentary.

Work is underway to elucidate biological mechanisms. Some groups have implicated the Fc region of antibodies. Another group has reported EGFR and MDM2/MDM4 amplifications in patients with HPD, note Subbiah and colleagues.

Other ""[p]roposed contributing pathological mechanisms include modulation of tumor immune microenvironment through macrophages and regulatory T cells as well as activation of oncogenic signaling pathways,"" notes Sehgal.

Both groups of authors emphasize the urgent need for prospective studies.

It is imperative to confirm underlying biology, predict which patients are at risk, and identify therapeutic directions for patients who experience HPD, Subbiah said.

The main challenge is defining HPD, he added.

Definitions that have been proposed include tumor growth at least two times greater than in control persons, a 15% increase in tumor burden in a set period, and disease progression of 50% from the first evaluation before treatment, he said.

The recent meta-analysis by Hyo Jung Park, MD, PhD, and colleagues, which Sehgal addressed in his invited commentary, highlights the many approaches used for defining HPD.

Depending on the definition used, the incidence of HPD across 24 studies involving more than 3100 patients ranged from 5.9% to 43.1%.

""Hyperprogressive disease could be overestimated or underestimated based on current assessment,"" Park and colleagues concluded. They highlighted the importance of ""establishing uniform and clinically relevant criteria based on currently available evidence.""

Steps for Solving the HPD Mystery

""I think we need to come up with consensus criteria for an HPD definition. We need a unified definition,"" Subbiah agreed. ""We also need to design prospective studies to prove or disprove the immunotherapy-HPD association.""

Prospective registries with independent review of patients with suspected immunotherapy-related HPD would be useful for assessing the true incidence and the biology of HPD among patients undergoing immunotherapy, he suggested.

""We need to know the immunologic signals of HPD. This can give us an idea if patients can be prospectively identified for being at risk,"" he said. ""We also need to know what to do if they are at risk.""

Sehgal also called for consensus on an HPD definition, with input from a multidisciplinary group that includes ""colleagues from radiology, medical oncology, radiation oncology. Getting expertise from different disciplines would be helpful,"" he said.

Park and colleagues suggested several key requirements for an optimal HP definition, such as the inclusion of multiple variables for measuring tumor growth acceleration, ""sufficiently quantitative"" criteria for determining time to failure, and establishment of a standardized measure of tumor growth acceleration.

The agreed-upon definition of HPD could be applied to patients in a prospective registry and to existing trial data, Sehgal said.

""Eventually, the goal of this exercise is to [determine] how we can help our patients the best, having a biomarker that can at least inform us in terms of being aware and being proactive in terms of looking for this...so that interventions can be brought on earlier,"" he said in an interview.

""If we know what may be a biological mechanism, we can design trials that are designed to look at how to overcome that HPD,"" he said.

Sehgal said he believes HPD is triggered in some way by treatment, including immunotherapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy, but perhaps in different ways for each.

He estimates the true incidence of immunotherapy-related HPD will be in the 9% to 10% range.

""This is a substantial number of patients, so it's important that we try to understand this phenomenon, using, again, uniform criteria,"" he said.

Current Treatment Decision Making

Until more is known, Sehgal said he considers the potential risk factors when treating patients with immunotherapy.

For example, the presence of MDM2 or MDM4 amplification on a genomic profile may factor into his treatment decision making when it comes to using immunotherapy or immunotherapy in combination with chemotherapy, he said.

""Is that the only factor that is going to make me choose one thing or another? No...,"" but it would make him more ""proactive in making sure the patient is doing clinically okay"" and in determining when to obtain on-treatment imaging studies.

Subbiah emphasized the relative benefit of immunotherapy, noting that survival with chemotherapy for many difficult-to-treat cancers in the relapsed/refractory metastatic setting is less than 2 years.

Immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors has allowed some of these patients to live longer (with survival reported to be more than 10 years for patients with metastatic melanoma).

""Immunotherapy has been a game changer, it has been transformative in the lives of these patients,"" Subbiah said. ""So unless there is any other contraindication, the benefit of receiving immunotherapy for an approved indication far outweighs the risk of HPD.""

42,Trend Reversed: New Cases of COVID-19 Decline in Children,"Editor's note: Find the latest COVID-19 news and guidance in Medscape's Coronavirus Resource Center.

New cases of COVID-19 dropped among children for just the second time in the past 6 weeks, but that was not enough to reverse the trend in children's share of the weekly total, according to a report from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children's Hospital Association.

Despite the decline in new cases, which fell from 88,000 to just under 80,000, or 9.7%, during the week of April 16-22, children represented 20.8% of all COVID-19 cases reported for the week, surpassing the pandemic-high 20.6% seen just a week earlier, the AAP/CHA report shows.

The total number of cases in children is now over 3.7 million — that's 13.7% of cases in all ages — since the start of the pandemic, and the cumulative rate of infection has reached 4,931 per 100,000 children, based on data from 49 states (excluding New York), the District of Columbia, New York City, Puerto Rico, and Guam.

Cases of more severe illness in children continue to trend lower. The cumulative number of hospitalizations in children (15,187) is only 2.0% of the total of almost 760,000 in the 25 jurisdictions (24 states and New York City) that report such data, and deaths in children now number 296, which is just 0.06% of all COVID-19–related mortality in 43 states, New York City, Puerto Rico, and Guam, the AAP and CHA said in their report.

Among those 46 jurisdictions, Texas has reported the most deaths (51) in children, followed by Arizona (29) and New York City (23), while 9 states and the District of Columbia have reported no deaths so far. Children represent the highest proportion of deaths (0.19%) in Colorado, but Guam, with 2 child deaths among its total of 136, has by far the highest rate at 1.47%, the AAP/CHA data show.

Data from the 25 reporting jurisdictions show that children make up the largest share of hospitalizations (3.1%) in Colorado and Minnesota, while New York City (1.9%), Georgia (1.3%), and Rhode Island (1.3%) have the highest hospitalization rates among children diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection, the two groups reported.

43,Study Finds Psoriasis Associated With an Increased COVID-19 Risk,"Editor's note: Find the latest COVID-19 news and guidance in Medscape's Coronavirus Resource Center.

People with psoriasis have a higher risk of infection with COVID-19 than the general population, but some systemic treatments appear to lower risk in patients, compared with those on topical therapy, a new study finds.

""Our study results suggest that psoriasis is an independent risk factor for COVID-19 illness,"" study coauthor Jeffrey Liu, a medical student at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, said in an interview after he presented the findings at the American Academy of Dermatology Virtual Meeting Experience. ""And our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that certain systemic agents may confer a protective effect against COVID-19 illness.""

Liu and coinvestigators used a Symphony Health dataset to analyze the health records of 167,027 U.S. patients diagnosed with psoriasis and a control group of 1,002,162 patients. The participants, all at least 20 years old, had been treated for psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis from May 2019 through Jan. 1, 2020, and were tracked until Nov. 11, 2020.

The ages and races of peoples in the two groups were roughly similar. Overall, 55% were women and 75% were White, and their average age was 58 years. Type 2 diabetes was more common in the psoriasis group than the control group (23% vs. 16%), as was obesity (27% vs. 15%). Of the patients with psoriasis, 60% were on topical treatments, 19% were on oral therapies, and 22% were on biologic therapy, with only a few taking both oral and biologic therapies.

After adjustment for age and gender, patients with psoriasis were 33% more likely than the control group to develop COVID-19 (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 1.33; 95% confidence interval, 1.23-1.38; P < .0001).

In a separate analysis, the gap persisted after adjustment for demographics and comorbidities: Patients with psoriasis had a higher rate of COVID-19 infection vs. controls (adjusted odds ratio, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.13-1.23; P < .0001). Among all patients, non-White race, older age, and comorbidities were all linked to higher risk of COVID-19 (all P < .0001).

Psoriasis might make patients more vulnerable to COVID-19 because the presence of up-regulated genes in psoriatic skin ""may lead to systemic hyperinflammation and sensitization of patients with psoriasis to proinflammatory cytokine storm,"" Liu said. This, in turn, may trigger more severe symptomatic disease that requires medical treatment, he said.

Reduced Risk, Compared With Topical Therapies

After adjustment for age and gender, those treated with TNF-alpha inhibitors, methotrexate, and apremilast (Otezla) all had statistically lower risks of COVID-19 vs. those on topical therapy (aIRR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.69-0.95; P < .0029 for TNF-alpha inhibitors; aIRR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.67-0.86; P < .0001 for methotrexate; and aIRR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.55-0.85; P < .0006 for apremilast).

Reduced risk held true for those in the separate analysis after adjustment for comorbidities and demographics (respectively, aOR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.77-1.00; P < .0469; aOR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.71-0.92; P < .0011; and aOR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.57-0.87; P < .0014).

Apremilast and methotrexate may boost protection against COVID-19 by inhibiting the body's production of cytokines, Liu said.

One message of the study is that ""dermatologists should not be scared of prescribing biologics or oral therapies for psoriasis,"" the study's lead author Jashin J. Wu, MD, of the Dermatology Research and Education Foundation in Irvine, Calif., said in an interview.

However, the results on the effects of systemic therapies were not all positive. Interleukin (IL)–17 inhibitors were an outlier: After adjustment for age and gender, patients treated with this class of drugs were 36% more likely to develop COVID-19 than those on oral agents (aIRR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.13-1.63; P < .0009).

Among patients on biologics, those taking IL-17 inhibitors had the highest risk of COVID-19, Liu said. ""The risk was higher in this class regardless of reference group – general population, the topical cohort, and the oral cohort,"" he said. ""This may relate to the observation that this biologic class exerts more broad immunosuppressive effects on antiviral host immunity. Notably, large meta-estimates of pivotal trials have observed increased risk of respiratory tract infections for patients on IL-17 inhibitors.""

In an interview, Erica Dommasch, MD, MPH, of the department of dermatology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, cautioned that ""the data from this study is very hard to interpret.""

It's likely that some patients with psoriasis on systemic medications ""may have been the most careful about limiting exposures,"" she said. ""Thus, it's hard to account for behavioral changes in individuals that may have led to the decreased incidence in psoriasis in patients on systemic agents versus topical therapy alone.""

Patients with psoriasis may also be tested more often for COVID-19, and unmeasured comorbidities like chronic kidney disease may play a role too, she said. Still, she added, ""it's reassuring that the authors did not find an increased rate of COVID among psoriasis patients on systemic agents versus topicals alone."" And she agreed with Wu about the importance of treating psoriasis with therapy beyond topical treatments during the pandemic: ""Providers should feel comfortable prescribing systemic medications to psoriasis patients when otherwise appropriate.""

As for the next steps, Wu said, ""we will be exploring more about the prognosis of COVID-19 infection in psoriasis patients. In addition, we will be exploring the relationship of COVID-19 infection with other inflammatory skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis.""

No study funding is reported. Wu discloses investigator, consultant, or speaker relationships with AbbVie, Almirall, Amgen, Arcutis, Aristea Therapeutics, Boehringer Ingelheim, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Dermavant, Reddy's Laboratories, Eli Lilly, Galderma, Janssen, LEO Pharma, Mindera, Novartis, Regeneron, Sanofi Genzyme, Solius, Sun Pharmaceutical, UCB, Valeant Pharmaceuticals North America, and Zerigo Health.

44,Novel BRAF-Inhibitor Cream Ameliorates Rash From EGFR Inhibitors,"An investigational novel cream containing a BRAF inhibitor appears to ameliorate the acneiform rash associated with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors such as cetuximab (Erbitux) and panitumumab (Vectibix).

The results come from a first-in-human, phase 1 clinical trial conducted in 10 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who were receiving treatment with either cetuximab or panitumumab and who developed a grade 1 or grade 2 rash while on treatment.

All were treated with the novel topical cream, dubbed LUTO14 (under development by Lutris Pharmaceutical).

For 6 of the 10 patients, the acneiform rash improved, say the investigators, led by Mario Lacouture, MD, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York City.

The study was published online April 28, 2021 in Cancer Discovery.

""Based on preclinical modeling and early clinical trial testing, we conclude that improving a topmost adverse event of EGFR inhibitor therapy with topical LUT014 could allow [maintenance of] quality of life and dose intensity, thereby maximizing the antitumor effects [from EGFR inhibitor therapy] while locally inhibiting dose-limiting skin toxicities,"" the investigators conclude.

The cream was well tolerated, and no dose-limiting toxicity or maximum tolerated dose was observed, although the cream did appear to be more effective at lower doses.

Rash is a common side effect of EGFR inhibitors. Previous studies have reported that 75% to 90% of patients experience ""some form of papulopustular, acneiform rash, which frequently leads to...suboptimal anti-cancer treatment due to treatment interruptions, dose reductions or permanent discontinuation of EGFR inhibitor therapy,"" they note.

Paradoxical Mechanism of Action

How the novel cream containing a BRAF inhibitor helps ameliorate EGFR inhibitor–induced skin toxicity is complicated, but at a cellular level, the mechanism seems somewhat paradoxical, the team comments. Skin toxicity experienced in the setting of EGFR inhibitor therapy is induced by inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Downstream inhibition of the MAPK pathway in turn results in, among other effects, inflammatory changes in epithelial cells that mediate the acneiform rash on the skin.

In contrast, ""BRAF inhibitors given systemically have an opposite effect on epithelial cells, resulting in paradoxical activation of the MAPK pathway,"" the authors explain. They hypothesized that topical administration of BRAF inhibitors similarly activates the MAPK pathway in epithelial cells, although it was important to develop a specific BRAF inhibitor that would optimally induce paradoxical MAPK activation. That they managed to do so was shown when they evaluated LUT014 in cell culture systems.

The next phase of the study is designed to include approximately 120 patients recruited from centers in the United States and Israel. Interim results are expected by the end of 2021.

The study was funded by Lutris-Pharma, the company developing LUT014.

45,Transgender Adults' Mental Health Improves With Desired Surgeries,"Transgender adults who have undergone desired gender-affirming surgical transition show significant improvements in mental health, with reduced rates of psychological distress and suicidality, compared with those who have not received surgery, according to results from the largest study of its kind on the issue.

""To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale, controlled study to demonstrate an association between gender-affirming surgery and improved mental health outcomes,"" the authors write in an article published online April 28 in JAMA Surgery.

""It was quite surprising to see significantly better mental health outcomes across every examined measure, including suicide attempts, among those who received all of their desired surgeries,"" lead author Anthony N. Almazan, BA, an MD/MPH candidate at Harvard Medical School and the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts, told Medscape Medical News.

""It was also striking to observe that the magnitudes of these associations were so much stronger compared to those in the group that received only some of their desired surgeries,"" he said.

The findings are from an analysis that Almazan and senior author Alex S. Keuroghlian, MD, MPH, an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of the National LGBTQIA+ Health Education Center at the Fenway Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, conducted. They analyzed data on 27,715 transgender and gender-diverse adults across the United States (including US territories and US military bases abroad) who participated in the US Transgender Survey from August to September 2015.

After adjustment for sociodemographic factors and other types of gender-affirming care, those who reported having undergone one or more types of gender-affirming surgery at least 2 years prior to taking the survey (12.8%) had significantly lower rates of past-month psychological distress (assessed with the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale; adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.58), lower rates of past-year smoking (aOR, 0.65), and lower rates of past-year suicidal ideation (aOR, 0.56; all P < .001), compared with those who expressed a desire to have one or more types of gender-affirming surgery but had not yet done so (59.2%).

""The observed associations between gender-affirming surgery, psychological distress, and suicide risk reinforce previous small-sample studies suggesting that gender-affirming surgery improves mental health and quality of life among transgender and gender diverse people,"" the authors write.

Most respondents in the study (81.1%) were between the ages of 18 and 44 years, and 82.1% identified as White. Overall, 38.8% identified as transgender women, 32.5% as transgender men, and 26.6% as nonbinary.

Previous research has shown that 41% of transgender people attempt suicide over the course of their life, that 33% use tobacco, and that 27% to 61% engage in binge drinking.

Results Suggest a Dose-Response Relationship

The primary analysis showed no statistically significant associations between gender-affirming surgeries and improvements in past-month binge alcohol use or past-year suicide attempts.

However, a post hoc analysis that compared respondents who had undergone all of their desired gender-affirming surgeries (n = 2448) with respondents who had received only some desired surgeries (n = 3331) showed a significant reduction in the odds of past-month binge alcohol use as well as all of the other adverse mental health outcomes (P < .001 for all).

""[The findings] suggest a potential dose-response relationship between surgical gender affirmation and mental health outcomes,"" Almazan said. ""To our knowledge, this is the first study to suggest such a relationship.""

In light of the substantially lower percentage of transgender patients who had received all desired gender-affirming surgical procedures compared with those who desired surgery but had not received it (12.8% vs 59.2%), the findings should further support efforts to improve access to patients desiring the surgery, the authors add.

""For every adverse mental health outcome, the percentage of respondents who endorsed it was lower in the exposure group than in the control group,"" they state.

""An Important Addition to the Literature""

In commenting on the study, Laura Erickson-Schroth, MD, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Columbia University Medical Center and consulting psychiatrist with the Hetrick-Martin Institute for LGBTQ Youth, in New York City, noted that ""this study has some significant strengths that make it an important addition to the literature.

""This is the largest study of its kind by far,"" she told Medscape Medical News. ""It also has the benefit of comparing those who have had surgeries with those who want them, rather than with all those who have not had surgeries.""

Erickson-Schroth agreed that the study underscores that many more transgender people are interested in surgeries than have access to them.

""My hope is that studies like this one will provide the evidence that insurance companies and health providers need to make surgeries more accessible to those who desire them,"" she said.

Erickson-Schroth added that she has seen first hand the improvements that come about when patients are able to undergo their desired surgeries.

""I'm not surprised at all about the results,"" she said. ""I work with trans young people at Hetrick-Martin Institute for LGBTQ Youth in New York City, and many of my clients who have had surgeries have had significant improvements in their depressive symptoms, anxiety, self-confidence, and sense of self.""

The authors of an accompanying editorial note that the mental health screening necessary to be a candidate for gender-affirming surgery could confound the outcomes.

Nevertheless, ""this report contributes additional evidence to support the efficacy of gender-affirming surgery in alleviating dysphoria,"" they write.

""Mental health outcomes are among the most vital end points to study, given the fundamental intent of gender-affirming surgery is to provide patients with relief from gender dysphoria and improvement of psychosocial distress.

""Much of the data on this topic come from observational studies that lack either control groups or adequate sample size,"" they write.

The study received funding from the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute. Co-author Keuroghlian stands to receive future royalties as editor of a forthcoming McGraw-Hill Education textbook on transgender and gender diverse care. Erickson-Schroth and the editorialists have disclosed no relevant financial relationships.

46,Pediatric Bronchiolitis: Less Is More,"A common cause of infant morbidity and hospitalization in developed countries, infant viral bronchiolitis, has long been bedeviled by treatment uncertainty beyond supportive care.

Rationales for most pharmacologic treatments continue to be debated, and clinical practice guidelines generally advise respiratory and hydration support, discouraging the use of chest radiography, albuterol, glucocorticoids, antibiotics, and epinephrine.

Despite evidence that the latter interventions are ineffective, they are still too often applied, according to two recent studies, one in Pediatrics, the other in JAMA Pediatrics.

""The pull of the therapeutic vacuum surrounding this disease has been noted in the pages of this journal for at least 50 years, with Wright and Beem writing in 1965 that 'energies should not be frittered away by the annoyance of unnecessary or futile medications and procedures' for the child with bronchiolitis,"" said emergency physicians Matthew J. Lipshaw, MD, MS, of the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, and Todd A. Florin, MD, MSCE, of Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago.

These remarks came in their editorial in Pediatrics wryly titled: ""Don't Just Do Something, Stand There"" and published online to accompany a recent study of three network meta-analyses.

Led by Sarah A. Elliott, PhD, of the Alberta Research Centre for Health Evidence at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, this analysis amalgamated 150 randomized, controlled trials comparing a placebo or active comparator with any bronchodilator, glucocorticoid steroid, hypertonic saline solution, antibiotic, helium-oxygen therapy, or high-flow oxygen therapy. It then looked at the following outcomes in children aged 2 years and younger: hospital admission rate on day 1, hospital admission rate within 7 days, and total hospital length of stay.

Few treatments seemed more effective than nebulized placebo (0.9% saline) for short-term outcomes, the authors found. While nebulized epinephrine and nebulized hypertonic saline plus salbutamol appeared to reduce admission rates during the index ED presentation, and hypertonic saline, alone or in combination with epinephrine, seemed to reduce hospital stays, such treatment had no effect on admissions within 7 days of initial presentation. Furthermore, most benefits disappeared in higher-quality studies.

Concluding, albeit with weak evidence and low confidence, that some benefit might accrue with hypertonic saline with salbutamol to reduce admission rates on initial presentation to the ED, the authors called for well-designed studies on treatments in inpatients and outpatients.

According to Lipshaw, assistant professor of clinical pediatrics, the lack of benefit observed in superior studies limits the applicability of Elliott and colleagues' results to immediate clinical practice. ""These findings could be used, however, to target future high-quality studies toward the medications that they found might be useful,"" he said in an interview.

For the present, other recent research augurs well for strategically reducing unnecessary care. In a paper published online in JAMA Pediatrics, Libby Haskell, MN, of the ED at Starship Children's Hospital in Auckland, New Zealand, and associates reported on a cluster-randomized, controlled trial of targeted interventions.

Conducted in 2017 at 26 hospitals and with 3,727 babies in New Zealand and Australia, the study addressed drivers of non–evidence-based approaches with behavior-modifying approaches such as on-site clinical leads, stakeholder meetings, a train-the-trainer workshop, education, and audit and feedback.

The authors reported a 14.1% difference in rates of compliance during the first 24 hours of hospitalization favoring the intervention group for all five bronchiolitis guideline recommendations. The greatest change was seen in albuterol and chest radiography use, with other improvements in ED visits, inpatient consultations, and throughout hospitalization.

""These results provide clinicians and hospitals with clear implementation strategies to address unnecessary treatment of infants with bronchiolitis,"" Haskell's group wrote. Lipshaw agreed that multifaceted deimplementation packages including clinician and family education, audit and feedback, and clinical decision support have been successful. ""Haskell et al. demonstrated that it is possible to successfully deimplement non–evidence-based practices for bronchiolitis with targeted inventions,"" he said. ""It would be wonderful to see their success replicated in the U.S.""

Why the Slow Adoption of Guidelines?

The American Academy of Pediatrics issued bronchiolitis guidelines for babies to 23 months in 2014 and updated them in 2018. Why, then, has care in some centers been seemingly all over the map and counter to guidelines? ""Both parents and clinicians are acting in what they believe to be the best interests of the child, and in the absence of high-value interventions, can feel the need to do something, even if that something is not supported by evidence,"" Lipshaw said.

Furthermore, with children in obvious distress, breathing fast and with difficulty, and sometimes unable to eat or drink, ""we feel like we should have some way to make them feel better quicker. Unfortunately, none of the medications we have tried seem to be useful for most children, and we are left with supportive care measures such as suctioning their noses, giving them oxygen if their oxygen is low, and giving them fluids if they are dehydrated.""

Other physicians agree that taking a less-is-more approach can be challenging and even counterintuitive. ""To families, seeing their child's doctor 'doing less' can be frustrating,"" admitted Diana S. Lee, MD, assistant professor of pediatrics at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York.

Beyond that, altering practice behavior will need more than guidelines, Lee said in an interview. ""Haskell et al. showed targeted behavior-change interventions improved compliance with bronchiolitis guidelines, but such change requires motivation and resources, and the sustainability of this effect over time remains to be seen.""

At Lipshaw's institution, treatment depends on the attending physician, ""but we have an emergency department care algorithm, which does not recommend any inhaled medications or steroids in accordance with the 2014 AAP guidelines,"" he said.

Similarly at Mount Sinai, practitioners strive to follow the AAP guidelines, although their implementation has not been immediate, Lee said. ""This is a situation where we must make the effort to choose not to do more, given current evidence.""

But Michelle Dunn, MD, an attending physician in the division of general pediatrics at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said the American practice norm already tends more to the observance than the breach of the guidelines, noting that since 2014 quality improvement efforts have been made throughout the country. ""At our institution, we have effectively reduced the use of albuterol in patients with bronchiolitis and we use evidence-based therapy as much as possible, which in the case of bronchiolitis generally involves supportive management alone,"" she said in an interview.

Still, Dunn added, many patients receive unnecessary diagnostic testing and ineffective therapies, with some providers facing psychological barriers to doing less. ""However, with more and more evidence to support this, hopefully, physicians will become more comfortable with this.""

To that end, Lipshaw's editorial urges physicians to ""curb the rampant use of therapies repeatedly revealed to be ineffective,"" citing team engagement, clear practice guidelines, and information technology as key factors in deimplementation. In the meantime, his mantra remains: ""Don't just do something, stand there.""

The study by Elliot and colleagues was supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research Knowledge Synthesis grant program. One coauthor is supported by a University of Ottawa Tier I Research Chair in Pediatric Emergency Medicine. Another is supported by a Tier 1 Canada Research Chair in Knowledge Synthesis and Translation and the Stollery Science Laboratory. Lipshaw and Florin disclosed no financial relationships relevant to their commentary. Haskell and colleagues were supported, variously, by the National Health and Medical Research Council of New Zealand, the Center of Research Excellence for Pediatric Emergency Medicine, the Victorian Government's Operational Infrastructure Support Program, Cure Kids New Zealand, the Royal Children's Hospital Foundation, and the Starship Foundation. Lee and Dunn had no competing interests to disclose with regard to their comments.

47,RA Biologic's Serious Infection Risk Confounded by Order of Use,"The order in which tocilizumab (Actemra) is used in the sequence of treatments for rheumatoid arthritis could be muddying the waters when it comes to evaluating patients' risk for serious infection.

According to new data emerging from the British Society for Rheumatology Biologics Register – Rheumatoid Arthritis (BSRBR-RA), the line of therapy is a confounding factor when examining the risk for serious infection with not only tocilizumab but also other biologic agents.

The good news for patients, however, is that there doesn't appear to be any overall greater risk for serious infection with one biologic over another when the line of therapy is taken into account.

""We don't have any strong signal that there is an increased risk of serious infections with tocilizumab, compared to TNF inhibitors,"" rheumatologist Kim Lauper, MD, of Geneva University Hospitals, said in an interview after presenting the data at the annual conference of the British Society for Rheumatology.

This is in contrast to studies where an increased risk of infections with tocilizumab has been seen when compared to TNF inhibitors. However, those studies did not account for the line of therapy, explained Lauper, who is also a clinical research fellow in the Centre for Epidemiology Versus Arthritis at the University of Manchester (England), where the BSRBR-RA is managed.

""Tocilizumab is a treatment that we often give to patients after several other treatments, so they're really different patients,"" Lauper observed. Indeed, in the ""real-world"" setting, patients taking tocilizumab tend to be older, have longer disease duration, and have worse functional status than do those who might receive other biologics.

To look at the effect of line of therapy on the serious infection risk associated with commonly used biologic drugs, Lauper and associates examined data on more than 33,000 treatment courses, representing more than 62,500 patient-years.

Using etanercept as the comparator — because it represents the largest group of patients in the BSRBR-RA — the serious infection risk for tocilizumab, rituximab, adalimumab, infliximab, certolizumab pegol, and abatacept were calculated as an overall rate, and for their use as first-, second-, third-, fourth-, or fifth-line therapy.

The researchers adjusted their analysis for some clear baseline differences between the treatment groups, including age, prior treatment, disease duration, and comorbidities. Seropositivity, smoking status, general health status, and disease activity scores were also adjusted for in the analysis.

Crude hazard ratios (HRs), compared with etanercept, before and after adjusting for these already-known confounding factors were 1.0 and 1.2 for tocilizumab, 1.1 and 1.1 for adalimumab, 1.4 and 1.3 for infliximab, 0.6 and 0.8 for certolizumab pegol, 0.9 and 1.0 for rituximab, and 0.9 and 1.2 for abatacept.

Stratifying by line of therapy, however, changed the results: HRs were no longer significantly different, compared with etanercept, for tocilizumab, adalimumab, and infliximab for most lines of therapy.

Indeed, while the risk for serious infection occurring with tocilizumab was 20% higher overall, compared with etanercept, that risk was actually lower if tocilizumab had been used as first- or fifth-line therapy (HRs for both, 0.9) but higher if it had been used as a third- or fourth-line therapy (HR of 1.4 for both).

""We often use tocilizumab as a second-line, third-line, or even fourth-line therapy, and if we don't adjust for anything, we can have the impression that there are more infections with tocilizumab. But then, when we adjust for confounding factors and the line of therapy, we don't have this anymore,"" Lauper said.

""Line of therapy in itself is not a risk for serious infections,"" she said in qualifying the conclusions that could be drawn from the study. ""It may be a marker of the disease or some patient characteristic that is associated with a higher risk of infections."" Nevertheless, it should be taken into account when evaluating serious outcomes and possibly other safety and effectiveness outcomes.

""I understand concentrating on the hospitalized infections because the data are so much more robust,"" observed consultant rheumatologist Jon Packham, BM, DM, of Haywood Hospital in Stoke-on-Trent, England, who chaired the session. He queried if there were any data on milder or just antibiotic-treated infections. At present, there aren't those data to look at, Lauper responded, as this is something that's difficult for registers to capture because doctors often do not log them in the databases.

There are also too few data on Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors currently in the BSRBR-RA at present to be able to look at their rate of serious infection by line of therapy, Lauper noted. Because JAK inhibitors act on cytokines different from those affected by biologics for RA, there may be a difference there, but more data are needed on the JAK inhibitors before that question can be analyzed.

Lauper did not state having any disclosures. The BSRBR-RA is funded by the BSR via restricted income grants from several U.K. pharmaceutical companies, which has included or currently includes AbbVie, Celltrion, Hospira, Pfizer, UCB, Roche, Swedish Orphan Biovitrum, and Merck.

48,Pregnancy Increases Risk for Symptomatic Kidney Stone,"Pregnancy increases the risk for first-time symptomatic kidney stone formation which peaks close to the time of delivery but can persist even a year later, a population-based, case-controlled study suggests.

""We suspected the risk of a kidney stone event would be high during pregnancy, but we were surprised that the risk remained high for up to a year after delivery,"" senior author Andrew Rule, MD, a nephrologist at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, said in a statement from his institution.

""[So] while most kidney stones that form during pregnancy are detected early by painful passage, some may remain stable in the kidney undetected for a longer period before dislodging and [again] resulting in a painful passage,"" he added.

The study was published online April 15 in The American Journal of Kidney Diseases by Charat Thongprayoon, MD, also of the Mayo Clinic, and colleagues.

""The results of this study indicate that prenatal counseling regarding kidney stones may be warranted, especially for women with other risk factors for kidney stones, such as obesity,"" he noted.

First-Time Stone Formers

The observational study included 945 first-time symptomatic kidney stone formers between 15 and 45 years of age who were compared with 1890 age-matched female controls from the Rochester Epidemiology Project. The latter is a medical record linkage system for almost all medical care administered in Olmsted County, Minnesota.

Compared with nonpregnant women, the odds of a symptomatic kidney stone forming in a pregnant woman was similar in the first trimester (odds ratio, 0.92; P = .8), began to increase during the second trimester (OR, 2.00; P = .007), further increased during the third trimester (OR, 2.69; P = .001), and peaked at 0 to 3 months after delivery (OR, 3.53; P < .001). The risk returned to baseline by 1 year after delivery.

These associations persisted after adjustment for age and race or for diabetes, hypertension, and obesity. These results did not significantly differ by age, race, time period, or number of prior pregnancies.

The risk of a pregnant woman developing a symptomatic kidney stone was higher in women with obesity compared with those of normal weight (P = .01).

And compared with women who had not been pregnant before, one prior pregnancy also increased the risk of having a symptomatic kidney stone by approximately 30% (OR, 1.29; P = .03), although two or more prior pregnancies did not significantly increase symptomatic kidney stone risk.

Thus, ""it can be inferred that the odds of a symptomatic kidney stone peak around the time of delivery,"" the authors emphasize.

""The odds of a first-time symptomatic kidney stone then decreased over time and were fully attenuated and no longer statistically significant by 12 months after delivery,"" the authors add.

Thongprayoon says there are several physiologic reasons why pregnancy might contribute to kidney stone formation.

During pregnancy, ureteral compression and ureteral relaxation due to elevated progesterone levels can cause urinary stasis.

Furthermore, increased urinary calcium excretion and elevated urine pH during pregnancy can promote calcium phosphate stone formation. It is noteworthy that almost all pregnant, first-time stone formers had calcium phosphate stones.

""During pregnancy, a kidney stone may contribute to serious complications,"" Thongprayoon explained.

General dietary recommendations for preventing kidney stones include drinking abundant fluids and consuming a low-salt diet.

The study was supported by the Mayo Clinic O'Brien Urology Research Center and a grant from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The authors have disclosed no relevant financial relationships.

49,Doctors Lose Jobs After Speaking Out About Unsafe Conditions,"In April 2020, hospitalist Samantha Houston, MD, lost her job at Baptist Memorial Hospital–North, in Oxford, Mississippi, after she publicly campaigned to get donations of N95 masks for nurses. Houston filed a lawsuit against the hospital, saying she was improperly fired for speaking out. The lawsuit has not yet gone to trial.

In January 2017, emergency physician Raymond Brovont, MD, was fired by EmCare, an emergency physician staffing company, after reporting understaffing at hospitals with which it contracted in the Kansas City, Missouri, area. Brovont sued EmCare, and the company lost the case. In February 2019, it was ordered to pay him $13.1 million in damages.

These are just two of several cases in recent years in which physicians have spoken out about problems involving patient care and have been sanctioned. Other physicians who see problems choose to stay silent.

Doctors often hesitate to speak out because of the prospect of losing their jobs. A 2013 study of emergency physicians found that nearly 20% reported a possible or real threat to their employment if they expressed concerns about quality of care.

When physicians do not speak openly about important medical issues, the quality of care in their institutions suffers, says a co-author of the study, Larry D. Weiss, MD, JD, a retired professor of emergency medicine at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.

""Physicians can't effectively represent patients if they are always thinking they can get fired for what they say,"" Weiss says. ""If you don't have protections like due process, which is often the case, you are less likely to speak out.""

The COVID-19 pandemic put to the test physicians' ability to speak publicly about troublesome issues. In the first few weeks, healthcare facilities were struggling to obtain personal protective equipment (PPE) and to create policies that would keep patients and caregivers safe.

Doctors such as Houston took the initiative to make sure their institutions were taking the right steps against COVID-19 and found themselves at loggerheads with administrators who were concerned that their organizations were being portrayed as unsafe.

The Case of One Physician Who Spoke Out

One of the highest-profile cases of a physician speaking out and being removed from work during the pandemic is that of Ming Lin, MD, an emergency physician who lost a job he had held for 17 years at St. Joseph Medical Center, in Bellingham, Washington. Lin lost his job after he made a series of Facebook posts that criticized the hospital's COVID-19 preparedness efforts.

In an interview with Medscape Medical News, Lin discussed the details of his situation to a degree that rarely occurs in such cases. This is one of the most extensive interviews he has granted.

Postings on Facebook

Lin says that on the basis of an intense study of the virus at the onset of the pandemic, he developed many ideas as to what could be done to mitigate its spread. He could see how others dealt with COVID-19 while working as a locum tenens physician on his time off.

Lin says from past experiences, he did not feel that he could present his ideas directly to administration and be heard, so he decided to air his ideas about how his hospital could handle COVID-19 on his Facebook page, which drew a large audience.

Lin says he was certain that hospital administrators were reading his posts. He says receptionists at this hospital were advised not to wear masks, evidently because it would alarm patients. Lin says he posted concerns about their safety and called for them to wear masks. Soon after, the hospital directed receptionists to wear masks.

Lin's Facebook posts also criticized the hospital for taking what he felt was too long to get results on COVID-19 tests. ""It was taking them up to 10 days to get test results, because samples were being sent to a lab in California,"" he says. Lin says he suggested it would be faster to send samples to the University of Washington. Soon after, the hospital started sending samples there.

In just a couple of weeks, Lin says, he voiced almost a dozen concerns. Each time the hospital made changes in line with his recommendations. Although he didn't get any direct acknowledgment from the hospital for his help, he says he felt he was making a positive impact.

How Employers React to Physicians Who Speak Out

Physicians who speak out about conditions tend to deeply disturb administrators, says William P. Sullivan, DO, JD, an emergency physician and lawyer in Frankfort, Illinois, who has written about physicians being terminated by hospitals.

""These physicians go to the news media or they use social media,"" Sullivan says, ""but hospital administrators don't want the public to hear bad things about their hospital.""

Then the public might not come to the hospital, which is an administrator's worst nightmare. Even if physicians think their criticisms are reasonable, administrators may still fear a resulting drop in patients.

Houston, for example, was helping her Mississippi hospital by collecting donations of N95 masks for nurses, but to administrators, it showed that the hospital did not have enough masks.

""It is not helpful to stoke fear and anxiety, even if the intent is sincere,"" a spokesperson for the hospital said.

Administrator Fires Back

Lin's posts were deeply concerning to Richard DeCarlo, chief operating officer of PeaceHealth, which runs St Joseph Hospital. DeCarlo discussed his concerns in a video interview in April with the blogger Zubin Damania, MD, known as ZDoggMD.

Comments on Lin's Facebook posts showed that people ""were fearful to go to the hospital,"" he told Damania. ""They were concluding that they would need to drive to another hospital.""

DeCarlo said he was also unhappy that Lin did not directly contact administrators about his concerns. ""He didn't communicate with his medical director,"" DeCarlo said in the interview. ""The ED staff had been meeting three times a week with the chief medical officer to make sure they had everything they needed, but he only attended one of these meetings and didn't ask any questions.""

Lin maintains he did ask questions at the first meeting but stopped attending because he felt he wasn't being heeded. ""I found their tone not very receptive,"" he says.

Doctor Allegedly Offered ""Misinformation""

At the start of the pandemic, some hospitals made it clear what would happen to doctors who brought up lack of PPE or other problems to the media. For example, NYU Langone Medical Center, in New York City, sent an email to staff warning that speaking to the media without permission ""will be subject to disciplinary action, including termination.""

PeaceHealth took a different tack. ""It's not that we have a policy that says don't ever talk to the media,"" DeCarlo said in the ZDoggMD interview, but in Lin's case, ""what was at issue was the misinformation. His leader went to him and said, 'Look, you're posting things that aren't accurate.' ""

Lin disputes that he provided any misinformation. In the interview, DeCarlo cited just one example of alleged misinformation. He said Lin called for a tent outside the emergency department (ED) to protect patients entering the department from aerosol exposure to COVID-19. DeCarlo said the tent was not needed because fewer people were using the ED.

""To put it in an extreme way,"" DeCarlo said of Lin's posts, ""it was like yelling fire in a theater where there is not a fire.""

Lin says the hospital did briefly erect a tent and then removed it, and he still insists that a tent was a good idea. He adds that DeCarlo never mentioned any of the other suggestions Lin made or state that the hospital adopted them.

Doctor Gets a Warning

Lin says after he started posting his concerns, he got a call from the emergency department director who worked for TeamHealth, an emergency medicine staffing firm that contracted with PeaceHealth and employed Lin, too.

Lin says his immediate supervisor at TeamHealth told him the hospital was unhappy with his posts and that he should take them down and suggested he might be fired. Lin says the supervisor also asked him to apologize to the hospital administration for this posts, but he refused to do so.

""Retracting and apologizing was not only wrong but would have left me vulnerable to being terminated with no repercussions,"" he says.

""At that point, I realized I had crossed the Rubicon,"" Lin says. He thought he might well be fired, no matter what he did, so he took his story to The Seattle Times, which had a much wider platform than his Facebook page had.

Lin lost his job at St. Joseph a week after The Seattle Times story about him appeared. ""About 10 minutes before my shift was supposed to start, I received a text message from TeamHealth saying that someone else would be taking the shift,"" he says.

In a release, TeamHealth insisted Lin was not fired and that he was scheduled to be reassigned to work at other hospitals. Lin, however, says he was not told this at the time and that he only found out later that the new assignment would involve a pay cut and a significant commute. He says he has not taken any new assignments from TeamHealth since he lost his job at St. Joseph.

Lin has filed a lawsuit against PeaceHealth, TeamHealth, and DeCarlo, asking for his job back and for an apology. He says he has not asked for any financial damages at this point.

Since leaving St. Joseph, Lin has been working as an administrator for the Indian Health Service in the upper plains states. He says he can do some of the work at home in Washington State, which allows him to be with his wife and three young kids.

Lin no longer sees patients. ""I feel I have lost my confidence as a clinician,"" he says. ""I'm not sure why, but I find it hard to make quick judgments when taking care of patients.""

He says many doctors have told him about their own troubles with speaking out, but they did not want to come forward and talk about it because they feared more repercussions.

Do Doctors Who Speak Out Have Any Rights?

Because TeamHealth, Lin's actual employer, asserts he was never actually terminated, Lin has not been able to appeal his case internally in accordance with due process, an option that allows doctors to get a fair hearing and to appeal decisions against them.

The American Academy of Emergency Medicine pointed out this problem. ""Dr Lin, as a member of the medical staff, is entitled to full due process and a fair hearing from his peers on the medical staff,"" it said in a statement supporting him.

The Joint Commission, the hospital accreditor, requires that hospitals provide due process to doctors before they can be terminated. However, Sullivan says employers often make physicians waive their due process rights in the employment contract. ""The result is that the employer can terminate doctors for no reason,"" he says.

In the 2013 survey of emergency physicians, 62% reported that their employer could terminate them without full due process.

When Weiss, the Maryland MD-JD, advises doctors on their contracts, he says he generally tells them to cross out the waiver language. The applicant, he says, may also tell the employer that the waivers are considered unethical by many physician professional societies. In some cases, he says, the hospital will back down.

Conclusion

To maintain quality of care, it is essential that physicians feel free to speak out about issues that concern them. They can improve their chances of being heard by working directly with management and attending meetings, but in some cases, management may be unwilling to listen.

50,Study examines mRNA COVID-19 vaccine’s effectiveness across age and gender,"A team of scientists from Estonia has recently characterized the anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody response induced by an mRNA-based coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine in relation to age, sex, and side-effects.

The findings reveal that although the two-dose vaccine regimen initially induces robust antibody response in all age groups, older male individuals are particularly associated with a gradual decline in vaccine-induced immunity six weeks after the second vaccine dose. The study is currently available on the medRxiv* preprint server.

Background

After successful development and clinical validation, several COVID-19 vaccines are currently rolling out worldwide to curb the uprising trajectory of the pandemic. Among all vaccine types, so far, mRNA-based vaccines have shown the highest efficacy in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and reducing mortality. For instance, in the phase 3 clinical trial, the two-dose regimen of Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2) has shown an acceptable safety level and 95% efficacy against COVID-19.

However, studies investigating the impacts of age, sex, ethnicity, and other demographic factors on vaccine efficacy have shown that older individuals are particularly more likely to exhibit a weaker immunity in response to COVID-19 vaccination.

In the current study, the scientists have explored the dynamics of IgG-specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response after the first and second doses of Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2. They have also investigated whether age, sex, and vaccine-related side-effects can influence the vaccine efficacy.

Study design

The study was conducted on 118 healthy volunteers (age range: 21 – 68 years) who received two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine. The immune responses of the volunteers were examined up to 6 weeks following the second vaccine dose. Specifically, the post-vaccination time points for monitoring immune response were three weeks after the first dose, just before the second dose, one week after the second dose, and six weeks after the second dose. The post-vaccination immune responses were compared with the baseline immune response (before the first vaccine dose).

The serum samples collected from the volunteers were analyzed for IgG-specific antibodies against the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2.

Important observations

By estimating serum antibody titers, the scientists observed that compared to the baseline values, the anti-spike RBD antibody levels increased three weeks after the first vaccine dose. The antibody levels peaked at one week after the second dose, followed by a gradual decline. Specifically, they observed a 45% reduction in antibody level between one and six weeks after the second dose. The majority of volunteers showed a similar trend of declining antibody levels. However, only 4% of volunteers exhibited increased antibody levels at six weeks after the second dose.

Interestingly, they observed that the IgG-specific anti-spike RBD antibody levels in COVID-19 recovered patients were significantly lower than observed in volunteers who received the second vaccine dose. However, volunteers immunized with only the first dose showed relatively lower antibody levels than COVID-19 recovered patients.

Factors influencing vaccine response

The scientists identified age as a major contributing factor for vaccine efficacy, which showed a negative correlation with antibody response at all time points tested. The volunteers aged less than 40 years showed significantly higher antibody levels at all tested time points compared to those above 40 years.

Furthermore, they observed that the negative correlation between age and vaccine-induced immune response was significantly more prominent in male volunteers than female volunteers.

Vaccine-related side-effects

About 93% of volunteers reported having mild to moderate side-effects, including swelling/pain at the injection site, fatigue, malaise, headache, chills, fever, or myalgia. However, about 22% of volunteers reported having long-lasting side-effects that resulted in workplace absenteeism and impaired daily life activities.

Interestingly, some of the side-effects, including fever, headache, fatigue, malaise, chills, and nausea, showed a strong positive correlation with vaccine-related immune responses. This correlation was significantly more prominent among male volunteers than female volunteers. Regarding age variation, older volunteers showed relatively fewer adverse side-effects than younger volunteers.

Study significance

The study findings reveal a robust antibody response among healthy volunteers immunized with Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine. This observation further strengthens the effectiveness of mRNA-based vaccines in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.

Furthermore, the study indicates that the vaccine is relatively less effective in older males than older females. However, older people are less susceptible to have vaccine-related side-effects than younger people.

51,Study observes increase in Lyme disease-causing ticks across California’s woodlands and beaches,"Ticks can cause conditions like Lyme disease, Borrelia miyamotoi infections, and human granulocytic anaplasmosis.

US-based researchers – at Colorado State University and the Northern Arizona University – have discovered that disease-causing ticks are finding their way onto beachfront properties, including infestations in woodlands and beaches around North California.

The study, published in the journal Applied and Environmental Microbiology, highlights the importance of understanding the local host ecology and prevalence of zoonotic diseases for public health. Tick-borne conditions that occur in California may cause severe infections.

Further, the study aims to identify other habitats of disease-causing ticks, not just those found in oak woodlands, which have been tied to Lyme disease cases.

Habitat-host system for ticks

In California, the archetypal habitat-host system for natural Lyme disease transmission dynamics is the oak woodland of the northwest region, mainly where western gray squirrels are the predominant host reservoirs for the disease agent, Borrelia burgdorferi.

Another host reservoir of the western black-legged tick (Ixodes pacificus) is the western fence lizard. Lyme disease incidence is high in northwestern California, where the reported cases can reach about 50 cases per 100,000 person-years.

However, studies have noted that infestations with these disease-causing ticks surpass beyond the oak woodlands. This means that the risk of Lyme disease may increase as infestations occur in California’s diverse habitats.

Prevalence patterns of disease-causing ticks

The study aimed to examine the prevalence of disease-causing ticks, including the B. burgdorferi, B. americana, B. miyamotoi, B. bissettiae and A. phagocytophilum in coastal counties of central and northern California.

The team performed a survey of various sites and habitats in California to arrive at the study findings, including woodlands, grasslands, and the coastal chaparrals. This way, they can describe the spatial pattern of tick-borne pathogen prevalence in western black-legged ticks.

From 2015 to 2018, every winter and spring, the researchers examined areas in Northern California for Western black-legged ticks. Across all habitats, including areas near the beach, the team found similar levels of tick prevalence.

The ticks were also tested for the presence of five bacterial species that cause illness. The team found similar prevalence levels of B. burgdorferi in ticks found in both the woodland and chaparral.

The study findings showed that many Borrelia – B. burgdorferi, B. americana and B. bissettiae, were seen in habitats such as the coastal chaparral that does do not have reservoir host candidates.

Specifically, Borrelia-positive ticks were observed in coastal chaparral and prairie habitats from Marin, Santa Cruz, Sonoma, and Monterey Counties. When the team compared tick-borne pathogen prevalence in woodland and coastal chaparral habitat in Marin and Sonoma countries, the team found no difference. This means that the two habitats contain ticks that harbor the pathogen.

Meanwhile, the B. miyamotoi prevalence was higher in woodland habitats, and the prevalence of A. phagocytophlum did not differ according to habitat.

Further, the team found a higher infection prevalence of B. miyamotoi in nymphal ticks, and higher B. burgdorferi infection prevalence in adult ticks.

Since the data was gathered at different times, the differences in prevalence may show trends in Borrelia infection patterns, which can help monitor potential Lyme disease outbreaks in the areas affected.

Nevertheless, multiple measures of tick-borne infection prevalence can help provide a better understanding of local and regional pathogen prevalence.

Considering multiple pathogen species in the same habitat allows a more cohesive interpretation of local pathogen occurrence,” the team noted in the study.

What is Lyme Disease?

Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in the United States, caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi and rarely, Borrelia mayonii. The pathogen is usually transmitted to humans through the bite of infected black-legged ticks.

The signs and symptoms of the infection include fever, chills, fatigue, headache, muscle aches, inflamed lymph nodes, and a rash called Erythema migrans (EM). This rash appears in about 70 to 80 percent of infected patients, starting from the tick bite and expanding gradually over several days.

If the infection is left untreated, it can affect the joints and vital organs, such as the heart, brain, and spinal cord. Most Lyme disease cases can be treated effectively with a few weeks of antibiotics.",www.news-medical.net
52,Can a gaze measurement app help spot potential signs of autism in toddlers?,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex developmental condition that involves challenges in social interaction, nonverbal communication, speech, and repetitive behaviors.

In the United States alone, about 1 in 54 children is diagnosed with ASD. Boys are four times more likely to be diagnosed with autism than girls. Early diagnosis is crucial for treatment and therapies.

Researchers at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, USA, used computational methods based on computer vision analysis and a smartphone or tablet to help detect early signs of ASD.

The study, published in JAMA Network, detected distinctive eye-gaze patterns using a mobile device application in a smartphone or tablet. The method can help distinguish toddlers with ASD and typically developing toddlers.

The mobile app, which allows the child to watch short videos, can track gaze, detecting ASD with 90 percent accuracy.

What is Autism spectrum disorder (ASD)?

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability that causes effective communication, social, and behavioral problems. Although autism can be diagnosed at any age, the signs and symptoms usually appear in the first two years of a child's life.

People with ASD may communicate, behave, interact, and learn in different ways. Some ASD children may need assistance in their daily lives; others need less. Also, those with this condition's learning and thinking abilities may range from gifted to severely challenged.

The common signs and symptoms include making little or inconsistent eye contact, tending not to look at or listen to people, rarely share the enjoyment of objects or activities by pointing, unable or slow in responding to someone calling their name, facial expressions that do not match what's being said, and problem in understanding another person's actions.

Those with ASD may also have restrictive and repetitive behaviors like repeating specific behaviors or phrases, having focused interest, getting upset in slight changes in a routine, and being sensitive to stimuli, such as light, noise, or temperature.

Toddlers with ASD also tend to prefer looking at objects than people. This is common among children as young as 17 months who are later diagnosed with autism.

The gaze-tracking app

The study highlights the need for technology-based detection tools to spot ASD early. This way, children will be given the appropriate treatment and support more promptly.

The researchers conducted a study in prospective primary care clinics between December 2018 and March 2020. They compared toddlers with and without ASD.

More than 1,500 caregivers of toddlers were invited to participate during a well-child visit. Overall, 993 toddlers completed the study measures, including children between the ages of 16 and 38 months.

First, the children were screened using the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers during routine care.

The team used computer vision analysis to detect toddlers with probable ASD that quantified eye-gaze patterns elicited by the app. The results were compared between toddlers with ASD and those with typical development.

The app was not designed to diagnose autism but to help healthcare practitioners determine a child should be referred to a pediatric specialist for a formal diagnostic evaluation.

The team found that distinctive eye-gaze patterns were spotted in toddlers with ASD, characterized by reduced gaze to social stimuli and social moments during videos or movies. The children each took a test for less than 10 minutes, wherein three videos were shown – an adult playing with a toy or two adults conversing and two control videos showing a puppy or floating bubbles.

The phone or tablet's camera will record the child's gaze as they watch the clips. From there, the researchers referred 79 children to specialists for an autism evaluation. Of these, 40 of the children were later diagnosed with ASD.

The toddlers diagnosed with ASD spent more time looking at the videos with toys than at the person playing with them. Further, the team observed that the children with ASD did not follow the conversation flow as closely as the non-autistic children's gazes.

The app reliably measured both known and new gaze biomarkers that distinguished toddlers with ASD versus typical development,"" the researchers noted in the study. ""These novel results may have the potential for developing scalable autism screening tools, exportable to natural settings, and enabling data sets amenable to machine learning,"" they added.",www.news-medical.net
53,Can control theory explain differences in virulence and transmission of SARS-CoV-2?,"The currently raging pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is taking more lives today than over the first five months after its onset. The difficulty in gaining control of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) stems partly from the fact that most infections are asymptomatic or very mild. Moreover, the frequent emergence of escape variants that overcome immune inhibition elicited by earlier variants has also challenged attempts to arrest the virus’s spread.

A new study, released as a preprint on the bioRxiv* server, discusses variations in viral pathogenicity and in transmission, which are responsible for asymptomatic infection and for superspreading events. The ability to understand this would open the way to understand how this virus behaves the way it does, in terms of its virulence, its spread, and its emergent variants of concern.

Why control theory?

The surging number of infections is mainly because of the steep differences in viral virulence and spread between individuals. The two main determinants of such variation are the low levels of the host receptor, and the suppression of interferon, the innate antiviral host response.

To understand how this variation operates, the researchers chose to use control theory, which is a mathematical framework for the analysis of complex feedback systems. Feedback is thus viewed as a control tool to change the behavior of unstable systems.

As scientists in an earlier paper have observed:

The COVID-19 pandemic isn’t an obvious or typical engineering problem. But in its basic behavior it is an unstable, open-loop system. Left alone, it grows exponentially: Like many such systems, it can be stabilized effectively and efficiently by applying the principles of control theory, most notably the use of feedback.”

Control theory could help, they say, to offer an exit strategy that uses medical and socioeconomic feedback to both restrict viral transmission and manage the burden of cases over the longer term, when restrictions on mobility and social interaction are relaxed.

The advantage of using this approach in the current study is that its design overcomes the lack of knowledge about the specifics of the immune response and the epidemiology of COVID-19.

In addition, it allows the identification of mechanisms by which the virus can show differences in virulence and in its spread even in the best-case situations.

Study aim

The aim was to find the highest possible immune response by the host, by aggregating all the changes in the immune functions as a single control function. The highest or best-case immune function would be that which reduces virulence to the lowest possible, while also limiting viral spread. The various constraints used are the viral load, immune activity, and the entry of new virus.

The problem has both open-loop and closed-loop components. The first is intracellular and has to do with viral replication: cell entry, intracellular replication, and virion release. The outcome will be the number of productively infected cells arising from the originally infected cell.

The second involves immune control due to innate immune factors acting outside the cell.

Symptoms provide warning

The proportion of respiratory epithelial cells vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection is small, relative to rhinoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza virus. The number of cells that show productive infection following the infection of one cell can vary widely from sample to sample. This is borne out by earlier single-cell-based reports.

When the number of secondarily infected cells is higher, the viral load can be brought down only by a stronger immune response. This, in turn, will produce symptoms, which cause recognition of the illness.

As a result, the patient takes steps to avoid spreading the infection to others, such as self-isolation and quarantine. The researchers factored in a simplified version of such behavioral changes, with the warning signal being a scaled form of the immune response causing the patient to avoid social interactions with others.

The immune response also reduces viral shedding.

The researchers also implemented a long presymptomatic period with subsequent severe symptoms in all cases. If only contacts can be warned about the possibility of infection and quarantined, this model would make containment very efficient. This is because all infected individuals would be aware of the infection and take appropriate steps.

This chain fails when cases are completely asymptomatic, even if they are not as infectious as presymptomatic cases – and, in fact, they need not make up a major share of all infections for this to happen.

Interferon-based responses

Extracellular immune responses vary more with the level of productive infection in neighboring cells than interferon-based immune responses, which are in turn lower than interferon-suppressed responses.

The early use of interferon could help reduce the final symptom severity in patients who seem to have progressive disease.

However, interferon-mediated suppression of immune responses may prolong viral replication and shedding, as well as precluding behavioral changes prompted by warning symptoms.

Other viruses

The researchers also applied this to other viruses, such as the seasonal endemic coronaviruses (CoV) like HCoV-NL63, as well as the earlier SARS-CoV, are also ACE2-tropic viruses. While the first causes mild cold-like symptoms or none at all, the latter is associated with severe respiratory symptoms in most cases.

These infections may vary markedly in severity, causing extremely mild or extremely severe cases to be left out of the clinical case count, as they escape detection altogether or cause rapid death before any clinical suspicion of the true diagnosis arises. This is true of the spread of SARS-CoV, indicating that such variability in the transmission is probable.

However, HCoV-NL63 has low virulence, perhaps because the spike glycoprotein has low infectivity. Thus, few cells show secondary productive infection from a single infected cell.

Interferon a double-edged weapon

Interferon administration has been shown to modulate the severity of infection with CoVs, if given early enough. However, the greatest effect is if administered before symptoms begin.

On the other hand, clinical trials have shown that the presence of immunosuppression early in SARS-CoV-2 infection increases the severity of the illness.

The suppression of antiviral interferon production or release within infected cells is a common mechanism used by respiratory viruses. Thus, the use of such interventions may be better guided by control-theory-based estimates of efficacy.

If the host benefits most from immune control, viral replication is rapidly blocked, and both transmission and symptomatic disease are prevented. With interferon suppression, viral spread is maximum when the virulence is lowest.

Host variation plays a role here, such that even under such conditions, increased spread may occur as the virulence increases.

What are the conclusions?

The researchers found that according to this model, virulence and transmission are closely linked. The virus is mostly transmitted by presymptomatic cases that will eventually develop severe infection.

These patients have a highly productive infection of cells adjacent to the infected cell. The effect is most pronounced when groups of such individuals interact since one group is shedding virus at a high rate, while the high proportion of susceptible cells makes the other group very vulnerable.

This can be reduced by an advance warning which induces behavioral changes to limit transmission. Moreover, control theory may well guide the use of interferon in future novel pathogens, due to the extremely common observation of interferon suppression by respiratory viruses.

54,COVID-19 donor antibodies show broad cross-reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 variants and related viruses,"The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is only one of several very similar zoonotic diseases that have led to outbreaks over the last two decades. A neutralizing response aimed at a common viral target rather than proteins specific to each virus would be very helpful in ending the current pandemic as well as forestalling future similar outbreaks.

A new study, released as a preprint on the bioRxiv* server, reports on a set of antibodies from COVID-19 donor serum, which seems to be cross-reactive across multiple Sarbecoviruses, including the very similar SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV.

The spike antigen

All these coronaviruses (CoVs) have trimeric spike glycoproteins on their surface that mediate virus-receptor attachment and viral entry into the host cell. The spike has a receptor-binding domain (RBD) at the apex of each protomer.

The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the host cell receptor for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, as well as some of the other animal and seasonal human CoVs. The RBD exists in either the ‘up’ or ‘down’ conformation, but is accessible to the receptor only in the former.

The CoV spike protein RBDs are related to each other and appear to branch from a common stem. Their importance to successful viral entry makes them a natural and appropriate target for neutralizing antibodies.

RBD-targeting antibodies

They have been classified into four categories: class 1 is encoded by VH3-53/VH3-63 germline genes, and their short heavy chain complementarity determining region 3 (CDRH3) binds at an epitope that overlaps the ACE2 binding site and can bind only if the RBD is ‘up.’

Class 2 has a similarly overlapping epitope, but one that can bind both ‘up’ and ‘down’ RBDs. Class 3 binds to ‘up’ and ‘down’ RBDs on opposite sides, near an N-glycosylation site. Class 4 antibodies are typically weakly neutralizing and bind to a cryptic inward-directed epitope on ‘up’ RBDs.

The most potent neutralizing antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 are either class 1 or 2, and act by blocking RBD-ACE2 binding. They are therefore less conserved across Sarbecoviruses.

Class 3 and 4 antibodies directed against the RBD are better choices for broadly neutralizing activity, as shown by S309, a class 3 antibody to SARS-CoV-2 isolated from a SARS-CoV-infected donor.

Thus, the potency of neutralization is often traded off for increased cross-reactivity, as is common with circulating viruses that have multiple variants.

Broad binding spectrum

The current study focused on C118 and C022, both class 4 antibodies from COVID-19-positive donors, which were able to bind to and neutralize most of the Sarbecovirus RBDs from an array of 12, belonging to different clades, as well as SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) which have immune-evading and/or higher infectivity characteristics.

Only two RBDs were not recognized by C022, while C118 bound to all of them. To put this in perspective, class 3 antibody S309 bound half of them. When tested against the variant RBDs from circulating SARS-CoV-2, including that of B.1.1.1.7 and B.1.351 (the UK and South African VOCs), both showed comparable binding. This property is shared by the class 4 antibody CR3022 as well as S309.

Crystal structure

The crystal structure of C118 bound to SARS-CoV, and of C022 in complex with SARS-CoV-2, showed a highly conserved RBD epitope. This has been observed to be bound by other cross-reactive but less neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 class 4 antibodies such as CR3022, S304/S2A4 and EY6A.

The interactions are numerous and are based on van der Waals and polar bonds with the RBD. The Fab (antigen-binding fragment) would cause steric hindrance to ACE2-RBD binding, as well as ACE2 binding to the antibody-RBD complex. Thus, C118, C022, and C144 appear to compete with ACE2 for binding to the RBD, but not CR3022.

This suggests “a primary neutralization mechanism for C022 and C118 that prevents spike attachment to host cell ACE2 receptors.”

Neutralization assays

When tested against a set of pseudoviruses bearing mutant SARS-CoV-2 spikes with a single amino acid substitution, both C118 and C022 showed equal potency of neutralization as with the wildtype virus bearing the D614G spike.

The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50 values) were <1 μg/mL, with both antibodies, for almost all the viruses tested. The exception was C118 neutralization of SARS-CoV spike, with an IC50 almost five times as high as for the rest. In comparison, CR3022 is poorly neutralizing except for SARS-CoV and WIV1.

S309 is a class 3 antibody but showed high neutralization potency at nanomolar concentrations, except for B.1.1.1.7 and SHC014.

In addition to their broad spectrum, both C118 and C022 have greater neutralizing ability because they block part of the ACE2 binding site.

Highly conserved sequences

Most residues are highly conserved or substituted by synonymous residues between SARS-CoV-2 and other RBDs, which probably accounts for the broad cross-reactivity. In fact, 70% of residues are shared by both antibodies, and the majority of RBD contacts were completely identical across Sarbecoviruses.

Backbone interactions provide double protection

Both these antibodies have dominant long CDRH3 loops that allow binding to a highly conserved set of residues common to all Sarbecoviruses in an upward-facing direction that allows it to overlap the ACE2 binding site.

The long CDRH3 loops also interact extensively with the RBD backbone, especially with the cryptic RBD epitope at its base. Long backbone interactions allow binding to occur even with substituted residues in the side chains in different sarbecovirus strains or SARS-CoV-2 variants.

This type of substitution is rare, however, with the virus strains included in this study. However, this double layer of protection against escape mutations could explain the broad cross-reactivity and neutralization ability across Sarbecoviruses.

Increased intra-spike crosslinking may improve avidity

Class 4 antibodies not only require two RBDs in the ‘up’ position but also RBD rotation to overcome steric hindrance from adjacent RBDs, in some cases, as with S309.

When examined by cryo-electron microscopy, the spike trimer-C118 complex revealed a greater distance between the RBDs in the trimer compared to complexes between the Fab of antibodies from classes 1 to 3 and the spike.

The separation was also greater than seen in the ACE2-spike complexes. The importance of the greater distances available between the spike RBDs in the receptor-bound form is the possibility they offer for crosslinking within each spike, which is associated with increased avidity of binding.

This avidity effect was not observed with C118 for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV neutralization, however, though it is present with WIV1 and SHC014. Conversely, it is strong in C022 for all four pseudoviruses.

Moreover, the findings suggest that binding is followed by loss of spike trimer stability, which may contribute to neutralization potency.

What are the implications?

These results define a cross-reactive class 4-like epitope on sarbecovirus RBDs that can be targeted in vaccine design and illustrate a mechanism by which the cryptic RBD epitope can be accessed on intact CoV S trimers.”

These antibodies showed potent neutralization activity against all the sarbecovirus and SARS-CoV-2 viruses tested here, remaining robustly neutralizing against natural RBD mutations which define several VOCs in current circulation.

Mutations tend to accumulate on the ACE2-bindng region of the RBD, thus helping the virus to evade specific RBD-targeting antibodies. These antibodies possess multiple mechanisms to reduce the impact of such mutations.

The class 4 antibodies described here, C118 and C022, are of the type that results from natural infection, and thus their binding sites should be studied to come up with an effective immunogen design.

Further work may focus on proper selection of potent neutralizing class 4 RBD-targeting antibodies for increased potency, for their use in the treatment of this condition, as well as to design better and broader immunogens in the future.

56,Peptide nucleocapsid vaccine candidate elicits protective T cell immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in vivo,"With the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic showing no signs of abating, and some parts of the world displaying meteoric rises in the number of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections, the need to achieve herd immunity is as urgent as ever. Though many spike-based vaccines have now been rolled out, their efficacy is threatened by the emergence of immune escape variants. Logistical constraints also hamper the production and use of the most effective vaccines.

A new study, released as a preprint on the bioRxiv* server, describes a synthetic peptide used as a platform to generate protective adaptive cellular immunity to the virus in rhesus macaques, which are the gold standard for preclinical testing in humans.

Vaccine peptides

The scientists used synthetic vaccine peptide, within a biodegradable microsphere vehicle, along with adjuvants Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 and 9 (to enhance immunogenicity). The peptide is based on antibody-binding sites that are known to induce an immune response.

The nucleoprotein (N) antigen was selected as the target of the T cells for the following reasons: SARS-CoV infection was associated with a memory T cell response sustained for two or more years after infection in survivors; the N protein sequence shows 90% homology between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and for the selected epitopes only, 100% homology; there are much fewer mutations in this region that could lead to immune escape compared to the spike protein.

In fact, this region may be more essential to viral fitness, and therefore less susceptible to mutations.

The selected five epitopes recognize human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I, and have been studied in either SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2. With the addition of a sixth peptide, these are expected to cover over 90% of HLA haplotypes globally.

Vaccine formulation

Microspheres of Poly-L-lactide-co-glycolide (PLG), including the synthetic peptides and the TLR9 agonist, were generated to deliver the peptides intratracheally by spraying or by lymph node (LN) injection (the latter in two macaques only, as a first dose).

The animals were then challenged with the virus both mucosally and intratracheally. The presence of infection was assessed by clinical features, by measuring the viral load, and by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR).

Clinical features

Vaccinated animals had shorter and milder symptoms following viral challenge than the controls, including mild lethargy, fever and breathing difficulty.

Blood samples

Initial lymphopenia in all animals resolved by day 3 post-challenge in vaccinated animals but not controls. Blood monocyte counts increased in all animals from days 1 to 5, but continued to remain high in the vaccinated group.

Viral loads

Again, three of four controls continued to shed infectious virus by day 7 post-vaccination, but only one of four vaccinated animals. All in the latter group stopped shedding by day 10. Viral loads followed the same pattern, with a hundred-fold decrease in viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) in nasal swabs in vaccinated vs. control animals.

All swabs from all animals were negative for viral RNA by day 14.

Chest radiography

All vaccinated animals showed largely normal chest X-rays throughout the period of the study, while controls showed mild-to-moderate anomalies characteristic of COVID-19.

What are the implications?

The findings of this study indicated that SARS-CoV-2 infection in vaccinated animals tended to be milder, with lower viral loads, faster recovery from lymphopenia, and no pneumonia. In other words, the vaccination was protective against disease due to the virus.

This was underlined by the gene expression profiles, showing effective adjuvanting of the immunogenic peptides by the TLR4 and TLR9 agonists. They also found evidence of increased expression of both Mamu MHC Class I and Class II genes in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells, the latter being observed for the first time in vaccinated animals.

The cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response did not show a bias towards T helper 2 (Th2) cell response. This implies a lower chance of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of disease or vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD),

We provide evidence that application of this vaccine platform in SARS-CoV-2 challenged macaques provides protection from pneumonia-like pathology observed in virally challenged but unvaccinated control non-human primate (NHP) subjects, reduces viral loads as compared to unvaccinated controls, and induces changes in the gene expression patterns in recovered BAL cells consistent with enhanced antigen presentation capacity and markers of T-cells.”

The low mutation rate of this protein, as well as the ease with which the peptide sequences of these HLA Class I restricted epitopes for CTL epitopes can be customized, are attractive features of this vaccine candidate. Further, it is suitable for delivery by aerosolization rather than injection, and can be stored at room temperature without loss of stability, indicating the need for further validation and development.

57,"Ohio’s Amish suffered a lot from Covid, but vaccines are still a hard sell","The Amish communities of northeastern Ohio engage in textbook communal living. Families eat, work and go to church together, and through the pandemic, mask-wearing and physical distancing have been spotty. That has meant that these communities bore a high rate of infection and death.

Despite this, health officials are struggling to encourage residents to get vaccinated against Covid-19. Holmes County, where half the population is Amish, has the lowest vaccination rate in Ohio, with just 10% of the population fully vaccinated.

""About less than a percent [of Amish] are coming in,"" said Holmes County health commissioner Michael Derr.

Marcus Yoder, who was born Amish and is now Mennonite, said the few Amish who are getting the shots are doing so privately through doctors' offices and small rural clinics — and, they generally are keeping it to themselves.

""There were Amish people getting the vaccination the same day I was … and we all kind of looked at each other and smiled underneath our masks and assumed that we wouldn’t say that we saw them,"" Yoder said.

Many Amish do not want to get vaccinated because they’ve already had Covid and believe the area has reached herd immunity, he said.

""I think one of the main driving forces is the misinformation about Covid itself — that it's not more serious than the flu,"" said Yoder, who lives in Holmes County and still has close ties to the religion and community. ""They’re saying, 'Well, it didn’t affect me that much. Look at all these old people who survived.'""

Anti-vaccination conspiracy theories also have spread throughout the community, and there is a lack of awareness about the more contagious variants spreading across the country, Yoder said.

""I think we're going to see some more cases in our community, unfortunately, because of this,"" he said. ""There simply is a lot of Covid news fatigue. They simply do not want to hear about it, and that's really unfortunate.""

While some sort of herd immunity could explain why Holmes currently has a low incidence of new cases, Derr at the health department is concerned that those who previously had the virus may not be protected.

""As a region, we definitely surged over the winter, and we know that that happened about 90 days ago,"" Derr said. ""We’re primed and ready for another surge because we’re not vaccinating enough.""

Health officials in Indiana and Pennsylvania are also ramping up outreach in heavily Amish areas. Local health departments in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, home to the largest Amish population in the country, are connecting with Amish bishops to try to spread the word about the vaccines.

The widespread reluctance to be vaccinated in Amish communities is not surprising to West Virginia University sociologist Rachel Stein, who studies Amish populations across the country.

""We as non-Amish are more on board with preventative medicine,"" Stein said. ""They certainly don’t have that mindset that we need to do things to stop this from happening.""

Instead, she said, there's an acceptance that people will get sick and get better — or not. While childhood vaccinations have increased in Ohio's Amish communities in recent years, adults are still more hesitant, she added.

""There’s oftentimes frequent breakouts of whooping cough in a settlement, and it's just like … 'This is happening now. We’re in whooping cough season, and so it’s time to deal with this sort of thing,'"" she said.

In 2014, a measles outbreak spread rapidly through Ohio's largely unvaccinated Amish communities. Even after this experience, many Amish residents chose not to vaccinate their children against other diseases.

The low vaccination interest in Holmes County also follows national trends showing residents of rural areas are less likely to consider getting vaccinated.

A recent poll from KFF found 3 in 10 rural residents will ""definitely not"" get a Covid vaccine or will get vaccinated only if it is mandated.

Yoder thinks the best path forward is to encourage Amish residents who did get the vaccine to talk openly about their positive experience getting the shots.

""I think that hammering people for not doing it will not get us anywhere,"" Yoder said. ""Some of the local business leaders have done very, very well at saying, 'Look, let’s get the vaccination so we don’t have to wear masks in the future, so we don’t have to worry about social distancing as much in the future.' And they’ve used that tack and that has been a healthy way to approach it.""

Derr is trying to get business owners who employ Amish workers to encourage their staffers to get a shot. Health officials hope to eventually hold vaccine clinics at these businesses and take the shots to them, but not every business owner is on board with that yet, he said.

""People are going to listen to their friends and their family, people who they interact with more, and it’s going to be that telephone effect,"" he said. ""The more and more people we tell about it and the better experiences they have, word will get around.""

Derr expects more Amish will get vaccinated in the fall after the shots have been around for some time but worries that the community could see a spike in cases long before then.

58,You don’t have to suffer to benefit from Covid vaccination — but some prefer it,"If you think vaccination is an ordeal now, consider the 18th-century version. After having pus from a smallpox boil scratched into your arm, you would be subject to three weeks of fever, sweats, chills, bleeding and purging with dangerous medicines, accompanied by hymns, prayers and hell-fire sermons by dour preachers.

That was smallpox vaccination, back then. The process generally worked and was preferred to enduring ""natural"" smallpox, which killed around a third of those who got it. Patients were often grateful for trial-by-immunization — once it was over, anyway.

""Thus through the Mercy of God, I have been preserved through the Distemper of the Small Pox,"" wrote one Peter Thatcher in 1764, after undergoing the process in a Boston inoculation hospital. ""Many and heinous have been my sins, but I hope they will be washed away.""

Today, Americans are once again surprisingly willing, even eager, to suffer a little for the reward of immunity from a virus that has turned the world upside down.

Roughly half of those vaccinated with the Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines, and in particular women, experience unpleasantness, from hot, sore arms to chills, headache, fever and exhaustion. Sometimes they boast about the symptoms. They often welcome them.

Suspicion about what was in the shots grew in the mind of Patricia Mandatori, an Argentine immigrant in Los Angeles, when she hardly felt the needle going in after her first dose of the Moderna vaccine at a March appointment.

A day later, though, with satisfaction, she ""felt like a truck hit me,"" Mandatori said. ""When I started to feel rotten I said, 'Yay, I got the vaccination.' I was happy. I felt relieved.""

While the symptoms show your immune system is responding to the vaccine in a way that will protect against disease, evidence from clinical trials showed that people with few or no symptoms were also protected. Don't feel bad if you don't feel bad, the experts say.

""This is the first vaccine in history where anyone has ever complained about not having symptoms,"" said immunologist Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.

To be sure, there is some evidence of stronger immune response in younger people — and in those who get sick when vaccinated. A small study at the University of Pennsylvania showed that people who reported systemic side effects such as fever, chills and headache may have had somewhat higher levels of antibodies. The large trial for Pfizer's vaccine showed the same trend in younger patients.

But that doesn't mean people who don't react to the vaccine severely are less protected, said Dr. Joanna Schaenman, an expert on infectious diseases and the immunology of aging at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. While the symptoms of illness are undoubtedly part of the immune response, the immune response that counts is protection, she said. ""That is preserved across age groups and likely to be independent of whether you had local or systemic side effects or not.""

The immune system responses that produce post-vaccination symptoms are thought to be triggered by proteins called toll-like receptors, which reside on certain immune cells. These receptors are less functional in older people, who are also likely to have chronic, low-grade activation of their immune systems that paradoxically mutes the more rapid response to a vaccine.

But other parts of their immune systems are responding more gradually to the vaccine by creating the specific types of cells needed to protect against the coronavirus. These are the so-called memory B cells, which make antibodies to attack the virus, and ""killer T cells"" that track and destroy virus-infected cells.

Many other vaccines, including those that prevent hepatitis B and bacterial pneumonia, are highly effective while having relatively mild side effect profiles, Schaenman noted.

Whether you have a strong reaction to the vaccine ""is an interesting but, in a sense, not vital question,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of infectious disease at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. The bottom line, he said: ""Don't worry about it.""

There was a time when doctors prescribed cod-liver oil and people thought medicine had to taste bad to be effective. People who get sick after Covid vaccination ""feel like we've had a tiny bit of suffering, we've girded our loins against the real thing,"" said Schaenman (who had a slight fever). ""When people don't have the side effects, they feel they've been robbed"" of the experience.

Still, side effects can be a hopeful sign, especially when they end, says McCarty Memorial Christian Church leader Eddie Anderson, who has led efforts to vaccinate Black churchgoers in Los Angeles. He helps them through the rocky period by reminding them of the joyful reunions with children and grandchildren that will be possible post-vaccination.

""I'm a Christian pastor,'' he said. ""I tell them, 'If you make it through the pain and discomfort, healing is on the other side. You can be fully human again.'""

59,New compound could alleviate neurological symptoms of CHARGE syndrome,"CHARGE syndrome is a rare genetic disorder affecting about 1 in 10,000 newborns. It can lead to neurological and behavioural disorders for which no treatment is currently available. Dr. Kessen Patten and his team, from the Institut national de la recherche scientifique (INRS) have just discovered a compound that could alleviate these symptoms. The results of their research were published in the journal EMBO Reports.

Understanding neurological disorders

First described in 1979, CHARGE syndrome is caused by mutations in the CHD7 gene and is associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as intellectual disability, attention deficit disorder with or without hyperactivity, seizures and autism spectrum disorder. Dr. Patten's research team studied the neurological symptoms of this syndrome, which are still poorly understood.

The team developed a genetic model of zebrafish with loss of function of the CHD7 gene similar to that observed in humans. They found that the CHD7 gene regulated the type of GABAergic neurons that are essential for proper brain function.

""The loss of function of CHD7 appears to cause developmental and functional abnormalities in GABAergic neurons in the zebrafish brain that are related to the observed neurological and behavioural disorders,"" explained Dr. Patten, who specializes in genetics and neurodegenerative diseases. The team also identified molecular events controlled by the CHD7 gene to explain these neurological symptoms in their genetic model. Similar findings were made using cells from patients with the disease.

Finding a drug

The research team tested hundreds of compounds already approved for clinical use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Drug screening was used to identify potential candidates for treatment--ephedrine was selected as the most therapeutic compound. ""We observed therapeutic effects on both, the neurological and behavioural symptoms,"" said PhD student Priyanka Jamadagni, lead author of the article. ""It allowed the diseased zebrafish model to partially recover its normal functions.""

This research opens the door to new avenues for the treatment of other neurological disorders with similar neuronal imbalances, such as autism spectrum disorder and hyperactivity.",www.news-medical.net
60,Pipeline Flex Embolization Device with Shield Technology FDA Approved,"Medtronic has won FDA approval for its Pipeline Flex Embolization Device with Shield Technology. The original Pipeline Flex was the first commercially available flow diverter for brain aneurysms. Shield Technology, a novel surface treatment that now encompasses the device, helps to reduce the tendency of the device itself to produce clots.

A few days ago New York University’s Langone Health center in New York City was the first hospital in the U.S. to employ the Pipeline Flex Embolization Device with Shield Technology. “The Pipeline Flex-Shield that we used today at NYU Langone to treat a giant left internal carotid aneurysm, represents a pivotal milestone in the evolution of flow diversion therapy—establishing a new vanguard for safe and effective management of complex cerebral aneurysms,” said Peter Kim Nelson, M.D., chief of Interventional Neuroradiology and professor of Radiology and Neurosurgery at NYU Langone Health, in a Medtronic press release. “Our team has long-anticipated the availability of this device for patients in the United States. The surface modification of the implant has demonstrated reduced material thrombogenicity, discernibly aiding delivery through tortuous vascular anatomy with improved delivery and resheathing forces compared to earlier generation flow diverters.”

Some details from a study evaluating the Pipeline with Shield Tecnhology, according to Medtronic:

“…results from the SHIELD Study (Periprocedural to 1-year safety and efficacy outcomes with the Pipeline Embolization Device with Shield technology for intracranial aneurysms: a prospective, post-market, multi-center study) demonstrate that the third-generation Pipeline Flex Embolization Device with Shield Technology continues the strong record of safety and efficacy of flow diversion therapy with the Medtronic family of products. Results show 77.2% complete aneurysm occlusion at 12 months, a 3.2% primary safety endpoint, and 93.1% complete wall apposition post-procedure.

61,3D Printed Shields Protect Guts During Radiotherapy,"Researchers at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and MIT have developed 3D printed shields to protect the gastrointestinal tract from the side effects of radiotherapy. Using CT scans, the devices can be custom printed to suit each patient’s anatomy. The materials they’re made of contain high atomic number elements that help to shield tissues from gamma and X-rays.

Radiotherapy can be highly effective at targeting tumors and helping to shrink them. However, it can also have significant consequences for nearby healthy tissues. The side effects can be particularly pronounced in the delicate tissues of the mouth and gastrointestinal tract, and range from esophagitis and proctitis to mucositis.

“It’s not uncommon for gastroenterologists to be called in to consult on a case to support a patient who is experiencing side effects of radiation in the esophagus, small intestine or anywhere else in the gastrointestinal tract,” said C. Giovanni Traverso, a researcher involved in the project, via a press release.

“When we treat patients with radiation, we do our best to minimize the area of healthy tissue that receives radiation and break up treatment into small doses, but it’s a fine balance. We want to administer the most dose we can to shrink the tumor without causing damage to healthy tissue,” added James Byrne, another researcher involved in the study. “Our goal through this project was to find an innovative solution that could offer personalized protection for patients.”

The team tested a variety of materials for their suitability as a radiation shield – the materials needed to be 3D printable and also needed to contain high atomic number materials that help to block gamma and X-rays that cause tissue damage during radiotherapy. Interestingly, the shields can be custom made for each patient, based on CT scans.

After printing, the shield materials need to be placed in the body in areas where they can provide maximal protection. So far, the researchers have tested their devices in pigs and rats, and found that the shields can protect healthy tissue when placed in the rectum and mouth.

The researchers have also simulated how the devices would work in humans, and have estimated that they would reduce radiation exposure in the mouth by up to 30% in head and neck cancer patients, and by up to 15% in the gastrointestinal tract in prostate cancer patients.

62,Ultrasonic Biopsy Needle for Larger Tissue Samples,"Researchers at Aalto University in Finland have developed an ultrasonically actuated needle that can retrieve a large amount of tissue during a biopsy, without the pain and complications associated with using bigger needles. The technique could be very useful when clinicians need to obtain tissue samples for molecular tumor diagnostics, since obtaining high quality samples is crucial, given the expense of molecular profiling procedures. The technique may also help to reduce patient inconvenience associated with repeat biopsies because of an initial poor tissue sample.

“Biopsy yields – the amount of tissue extracted – are often inadequate, with some studies showing that up to a third of fine-needle biopsies struggle to get enough tissue for a reliable diagnosis,” said Professor Heikki Nieminen, a researcher involved in the study, in an Aalto announcement. “A biopsy can be painful, and the wait for the results from a diagnostic test can be a highly distressing time for the patient and family, especially if diagnosis needs re-biopsies to be conclusive. We wanted to make the procedure more gentle for the patient, and increase the certainty that the test will be able to give us an answer on the first attempt.”

One of the issues with biopsies is the need to use wide bore needles to ensure that enough tissue is obtained for the required diagnostic tests. “They are painful for the patient and can also cause bleeding – you don’t want to use a core needle unless you have to,” said Kenneth Pritzker, another researcher that worked on the new device. “At body temperature, human tissue exists as something that behaves part-way between being a solid and a liquid. The breakthrough here is that by making the needle tip vibrate ultrasonically, we’re able to make the tissue flow more like a liquid, which allows us to extract more of it through a narrow needle.”

The device can house a conventional syringe with a fine needle. It can then vibrate the needle tip approximately 30,000 times per second. The vibrations cause the tissue to behave more like a liquid and so more tissue can enter the fine needle. “The vibrations provide energy to the tissue to make it more fluid-like,” said Emanuele Perra, a third researcher involved in the study. “The vibrations are localized to just the tip, so it doesn’t affect any other tissue except a small region around the needle. We were able to show that the ultrasonic vibrations increase the biopsy yield by 3 to 6 times compared to the same needle without ultrasound, which was even greater than we hoped for.”

Here’s a video demonstrating a comparison between a conventional biopsy needle and an ultrasonic one:

63,"Non-Surgical Solution for Fecal Incontinence: Interview with Miles Rosen, CEO of Pelvalon","Fecal incontinence can be extremely challenging for those who suffer it. The condition can be embarrassing, making it difficult for people to tell others or even their doctor about it, and it is more common than you might think. Fecal incontinence can affect anyone, but a key group of patients includes women during menopause, in whom it is often associated with previous pelvic trauma, such as that which occurs during child-birth.

Treatment options are relatively limited and either tend to be minimalist, such as lifestyle changes, or pretty intense, such as expensive surgical implants. There was a gap for a low-risk and low-cost treatment that could still achieve impressive efficacy. This is the niche that Pelvalon, a medtech company based in Santa Clara, California, hopes to fill.

Pelvalon’s Eclipse system is conceived as a minimally invasive solution to fecal incontinence in women. It consists of a vaginal insert that can be inflated to control the nearby rectum, where gentle pressure from the inflated insert obstructs the passage of stool. When the user needs to use the restroom, the insert can easily be deflated for that purpose.

Medgadget had the opportunity to speak with Miles Rosen, founder and CEO at Pelvalon, about the technology.

Conn Hastings, Medgadget: Please give us an overview of fecal incontinence, and the consequences it can have for patients.

Miles Rosen, Pelvalon: Just like loss of bladder control, loss of bowel control is a pelvic floor disorder, in which symptoms often begin around the age of menopause and can trace back to child delivery or other past trauma to the pelvic region. Nerve or muscle damage in the pelvic region can affect bowel control, as can diarrhea, Irritable Bowel Syndrome or other gastrointestinal conditions. It can be embarrassing, even devastating in the wrong circumstances. Women who lose control of their bowels often feel like they have lost control of their life.

Medgadget: How common is fecal incontinence? It is rare for people to talk about it, so most are likely unaware when someone is suffering from the condition.

Miles Rosen: Since many people don’t talk about loss of bowel control, it’s more common than you might think. It affects 10-15% of women, with the average age of onset being 47 to 55. Accidents can happen on a monthly or more frequent basis. Many women report fearing a simple trip to work or the grocery store, not being able to exercise, and missing out on valuable time with friends and family. Unfortunately, many women don’t bring it up with their doctor due to embarrassment and a belief that there are not good treatment options out there.

Medgadget: How is the condition currently treated, and what are the limitations with these approaches?

Miles Rosen: Typical first-line treatments include dietary changes, exercise and medications. Until now, there really weren’t any conservative treatments that had been proven effective short of invasive surgical implants. The most widely covered therapy is a surgical device that costs over $30,000 to implant. Physicians have commented that lower risk treatments are desperately needed, as there is a large gap in the treatment algorithm.

Medgadget: Please give us an overview of the Eclipse System and how it works.

Miles Rosen: A non-surgical vaginal insert, Eclipse is placed in a similar position as a tampon and has been cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat loss of bowel control. The insert contains no hormones or drugs, and can be inserted or removed at any time. A well-fit insert will be comfortable for almost all women. In fact, 96% of women who were successfully fit with the insert and completed a clinical study found it to be comfortable and either could not feel it or reported that if they could feel it, it was comfortable.

A detachable and discreet pump is used to inflate and deflate a balloon on the insert. The balloon is designed to control the rectum and prevent stool from passing before a trip to the bathroom. After a bowel movement, the balloon can be inflated again. This design allows women to actively control their bowels, while keeping the insert in place throughout the day.

Medgadget: How was the system conceived?

Miles Rosen: When I started working in the space, I was shocked to learn that fecal incontinence affects so many young, active women. Through the course of clinical trials, I’ve spoken to over a hundred patients about their condition. It strips women of having control over their lives, forcing them to give up careers, social engagements, and exercise. The uncertainty and fear associated with their loss of bowel control can be debilitating and isolating.

In talking with physicians, they would tell me that they didn’t have great solutions to offer patients, especially less invasive treatment ones. To fill this need, we worked with gynecologists to develop a new, non-surgical option for women that’s as easy to use and just as comfortable as other commonly-used female products. The technology originated from Stanford University’s Byers Center for Biodesign, a health technology innovation training program.

Medgadget: What are the advantages of the system compared with other solutions for fecal incontinence?

Miles Rosen: Eclipse has a huge advantage when it comes to the risk and cost profile. As I mentioned earlier, the only effective treatment to date is a surgical implant placed near the spine that costs over $30,000 to implant, plus ongoing annual costs. As a non-surgical vaginal insert, Eclipse can easily be removed at any time and has a dramatically different risk profile. In 10 years of clinical testing, there has never been a serious adverse event associated with the device.

Another advantage of the insert is that it is familiar to women and providers. Vaginal inserts have been used for decades with other conditions so it’s something providers and patients are used to. The user acceptance has been affirmed in the clinical data, with 96% of patients reporting that the insert was comfortable.

Additionally, Eclipse is quick and effective. Patients can leave the office continent on day one whereas with other treatments, the mechanism of action kicks in over time. Multiple clinical studies have shown the device to be over 80% effective, which is high in any disease state, but especially fecal incontinence, which has notoriously been difficult to treat.

The largest barrier for us has been reimbursement. Due to Eclipse being new type of device, it didn’t have an appropriate code and payment. With that now in place, it will significantly improve access to the technology. It will also provide cost savings to payers, as it is significantly cheaper and less invasive than the alternative treatments. Eclipse has already made a huge difference in the lives of the patients who have used it and we look forward to bringing this solution to more clinicians across the country.

64,New Software Helps Design DNA Nanorobots,"Researchers at Ohio State University have developed new software that allows them to rapidly design and simulate DNA nanorobots. Previously, it was challenging to engineer such tiny devices, but now researchers can map out their design in minutes. DNA-based devices have significant promise as medical technologies with potential applications in drug delivery and diagnostics.

Researchers are still pursuing the sci-fi dream of tiny machines that can enter our bodies and help to heal us. This latest development brings that reality a little closer. Developing DNA-based robots and devices at such a tiny scale poses a unique set of challenges. The new software, called MagicDNA, aims to streamline this process and acts as a replacement for older types of software that involved more painstaking manual design.

“Researchers have been doing this for a number of years with slower tools with tedious manual steps,” said Carlos Castro, a researcher involved in the study, in an Ohio State press release. “But now, nanodevices that may have taken us several days to design before now take us just a few minutes.”

The new software allows researchers to design the objects in 3D, which makes it easier to develop more complex objects. Researchers can also either use a “bottom up” design approach, in which individual strands of DNA can be manipulated into place, or a “top down” approach where the overall shape of the object is designed and then the software automatically populates it with DNA strands, or a combination of both approaches.

“Previously, we could build devices with up to about six individual components and connect them with joints and hinges and try to make them execute complex motions,” said Hai-Jun Su, another researcher involved in the study. “With this software, it is not hard to make robots or other devices with upwards of 20 components that are much easier to control. It is a huge step in our ability to design nanodevices that can perform the complex actions that we want them to do.”

The software also allows scientists to simulate how the designed device might move, to help them iron out any flaws before construction. “As you make these structures more complex, it is difficult to predict exactly what they are going to look like and how they are going to behave,” said Castro. “It is critical to be able to simulate how our devices will actually operate. Otherwise, we waste a lot of time.”

So far, the researchers have successfully tested some of their designs in the real world. They have hopes that their software will pave the way for functional DNA robots for therapeutic applications, including devices that can recognize a pathogen in the bloodstream.

“But a more complex device may not only detect that something bad is happening, but can also react by releasing a drug or capturing the pathogen,” added Castro. “We want to be able to design robots that respond in a particular way to a stimulus or move in a certain way.”

65,Software Spots Suspicious Skin Lesions on Smartphone Photos,"Melanoma, which accounts for over 70 percent of all skin cancers, occurs when pigment producing cells called melanocytes multiply uncontrollably. This cancer is typically diagnosed through visual inspection of Suspicious Pigmented Lesions (SPLs), and such early detection of lesions in a physician’s office are often life-saving. However, there are several disadvantages with this approach, including the high volume of potential lesions one has to biopsy and test before confirming a diagnosis.

To overcome these issues, researchers from MIT and a few other institutions around Boston, have developed a new deep learning tool to more easily identify harmful lesions from photographs taken with a smartphone.

A wide-field image of lesions on a patient are classified with new deep learning techniques to identify suspicious lesions. (MIT)

The paper, published in Science Translational Medicine, describes the development of the tool using a branch of artificial intelligence called deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). The researchers trained their tool using over 20,000 images, taken from 133 patients and from publicly available databases. Importantly, the pictures were taken using different personal cameras, to ensure that it would work with real-life examples.

Once the tool was trained using known examples, it demonstrated over 90.3% sensitivity and 89.9% specificity in distinguishing SPLs from nonsuspicious lesions, skin, and complex backgrounds.

One interesting aspect that distinguishes this tool from others is based on identifying lesions using the ‘ugly duckling’ criteria. This method, currently used by dermatologists, assumes that most moles on an individual appear similar to each other and are typically non-suspicious, with different-looking moles classified as ‘ugly ducklings’ for further investigation.

Criteria for classifying lesions as suspicious or non-suspicious include their circularity, convexity, inertia, intensity, and size.

By training the system on different features of moles such as circularity, size, and intensity, the accuracy of prediction was greatly improved: the algorithm matched the consensus of seasoned dermatologists 88 percent of the time, and matched individual dermatologists’ opinion 86 percent of the time. If the technology is confirmed, it could lead to significant savings in terms of clinical time and cost involved in the imaging and analysis of individual lesions.

“Our research suggests that systems leveraging computer vision and deep neural networks, quantifying such common signs, can achieve comparable accuracy to expert dermatologists”, said Soenksen, the first author on the paper, in an MIT press release. “We hope our research revitalizes the desire to deliver more efficient dermatological screenings in primary care settings to drive adequate referrals”.

66,Implantable Pump Delivers Chemotherapy to Brain Tumors,"Researchers at Linköping University, Sweden, and the Medical University of Graz, Austria have developed an electrical pump that can precisely deliver chemotherapeutic drugs into the brain. The technology is conceived as being implantable into brain tumor resection sites to deliver localized chemotherapy over extended periods. It is hoped that this approach can prevent tumor recurrence.

Unfortunately, brain tumor recurrence following surgical resection is all too common. It is difficult to remove all traces of the tumor without causing significant damage to healthy brain tissue, and therefore recurrence is inevitable for many patients. Delivering systemic chemotherapy is limited by its side-effects and by the presence of the blood brain barrier, which will not allow all chemotherapy drugs to pass through it.

At present, preventing recurrence can be attempted by leaving chemotherapy-loaded materials behind in the tumor resection site. Examples include chemotherapy-loaded wafers that break down over time and release the drug into nearby tissue. However, such systems allow only limited control of drug release, and this may result in localized side-effects such as cerebral edema and wound healing issues.

This latest technology aims to provide more controllable drug release for tumor resection sites, and consists of a small implantable pump designed to deliver gemcitabine, an effective chemotherapy drug that cannot pass the blood brain barrier. Excitingly, unlike many chemotherapy drugs, gemcitabine has minimal toxicity in healthy brain cells, meaning that is well suited for use in brain tumors, such as glioblastoma.

“The traditional glioblastoma treatment currently used in the clinics harms both cancer and neuronal cells to the same extent,” said Linda Waldherr, a researcher involved in the study, in a press release. “However, with the gemcitabine ion pump, we tackle only the cancerous cells, while neurons stay healthy. In addition, our experiments on cultured glioblastoma cells show that more cancer cells are killed when we use the ion pump than when we use manual treatment.”

The pump can be described as an organic electronic ion pump. It uses an electrical current to precisely deliver gemcitabine, which is positively charged, through an ion transport channel. Fortunately, the pump requires only a small current, which is advantageous from a safety perspective when delivering therapy in the brain.

So far, the researchers have tested the device with glioblastoma cells in vitro. “This is the first time an ion pump has been tested as a possible method to treat malignant brain tumors,” said Daniel Simon, another researcher involved in the study. “We used cancer cells in the lab, and the results are extremely promising. However, it will probably take five to ten years before we see this new technology used in treatments for brain tumors.”

67,Wireless Sensor Measures Deep Tissue Oxygen Levels,"Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley have developed an ultrasound-powered implantable sensor that can measure oxygen levels in tissues deep within the body and transmit these data to an external device. The technology could be useful in monitoring transplant viability or oxygen exposure in preterm infants. It also has potential to be adapted to measure other biochemical markers, such as carbon dioxide concentrations or pH levels.

Oxygen is crucial for living tissues, and poor oxygenation leads to cell death. This process forms the basis for various pathological phenomena, but clinicians can struggle to measure tissue oxygenation, at least in tissues that aren’t near the surface of the body. Current methods to assess tissue oxygenation involve using infrared light, but this can only penetrate a few centimeters at most.

“It’s very difficult to measure things deep inside the body,” said Michel Maharbiz, a researcher involved in the study, in a Berkeley announcement. “The device demonstrates how, using ultrasound technology coupled with very clever integrated circuit design, you can create sophisticated implants that go very deep into tissue to take data from organs.”

The new implants are powered using ultrasonic waves, which can travel long distances through the body. An external probe transmits ultrasonic vibrations through the body, which power the tiny device implanted inside. Data is transmitted back by reflecting these ultrasonic waves while embedding in them data packets on tissue oxygenation levels. This technique allows for bidirectional data exchange with devices deep inside the body.

Oxygen sensing occurs through an on-board LED and optical detector within the impalnt. The device itself is tiny, and the researchers describe it as smaller than a ladybug. So far, they have tested the device by monitoring the oxygen levels in muscle in live sheep.

“One potential application of this device is to monitor organ transplants, because in the months after organ transplantation, vascular complications can occur, and these complications may lead to graft dysfunction,” said Soner Sonmezoglu, another researcher involved in the project. “It could be used to measure tumor hypoxia, as well, which can help doctors guide cancer radiation therapy.”

An important potential application of the new technology involves using it to help manage oxygen levels in premature infants. “In premature infants, for example, we frequently need to give supplemental oxygen but don’t have a reliable tissue readout of oxygen concentration,” said Emin Maltepe, a third researcher involves in the project. “Further miniaturized versions of this device could help us better manage oxygen exposure in our preterm infants in the intensive care nursery setting and help minimize some of the negative consequences of excessive oxygen exposure, such as retinopathy of prematurity or chronic lung disease.”

68,Sweat Sensor Warns of Impending COVID-19 Cytokine Storm,"Researchers at the University of Texas and EnLiSense, a Texas startup, have developed a skin sweat sensor that can measure cytokine levels continuously for up to 168 hours. The technology has been adapted so that it can detect cytokines involved in the deadly cytokine storms that occur in patients with COVID-19 and other illnesses, such as influenza. The researchers hope that it might serve as an early warning system for an impending storm, allowing early treatment.

Cytokine storms involve a massive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, leading to intense inflammation that can cause significant damage to organs, sometimes leading to death. It can occur in severe cases of COVID-19, so methods to predict an impending storm would be very useful for clinicians. Early treatment with anti-inflammatories could help to save a patient’s life.

“Especially now in the context of COVID-19, if you could monitor pro-inflammatory cytokines and see them trending upwards, you could treat patients early, even before they develop symptoms,” says Shalini Prasad, a researcher involved in the study.

One option is a blood test to check if cytokine levels are increasing, but this is inconvenient, and provides only one snapshot in time. Continuous measurement is preferable, and these researchers have shown that sweat sensing may be a viable alternative.

The researchers adapted a previous sweat sensor that they had developed to detect cytokines involved in inflammatory bowel disease. It consists of a sensor strip into which passive sweat diffuses. The strip contains two electrodes and is loaded with antibodies against the cytokines of interest. When the cytokines bind, they change the electric current running through the device, and this is measured and wirelessly transmitted to a smartphone.

The current sensor measures seven different cytokines that are relevant to cytokine storms. These are interleukin-6, -8 and -10, tumor necrosis factor-α, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, interferon-γ-induced protein-10 and C-reactive protein.

The researchers have tested the device in a small number of volunteers, but eventually want to test it with COVID-19 patients. “Access to COVID-19 patients has been a challenge because healthcare workers are overwhelmed and don’t have time to test investigational devices,” said Prasad. “But we’re going to continue to test it for all respiratory infections because the disease trigger itself doesn’t matter – it’s what’s happening with the cytokines that we’re interested in monitoring.”

69,FDA Clears First AI Polyp Detection System for Colonoscopies,"Medtronic won FDA de novo clearance for its GI Genius endoscopy technology that can spot suspicious lesions during routine colonoscopy exams. The system works with any video colonoscope and can even process pre-recorded colonoscopies.

Even highly experienced gastroenterologists can miss a polyp while navigating through the colon. Computer vision technology can carefully process the entirety of every video frame to spot any irregularities associated with polyps. According to Medtronic, “the GI Genius module has demonstrated a 14% absolute increase in ADR [adenoma detection rate] compared to colonoscopy alone for both flat (42% increase) and polyploid (36% increase) lesions, thus increasing accuracy and reducing the rise of interval cancers which can occur between colonoscopies.”

The system simply displays a green box over any suspected polyp in a colonoscopy video, allowing the physician to get up close and get a better look at what is there.

“More than 19 million screening colonoscopies are performed in the United States each year. A key factor in the prevention of colorectal cancer is the integration of leading-edge technologies into gastroenterology practices to increase detection rates,” said Dr. James Weber, a gastroenterologist and CEO of the GI Alliance, in a Medtronic announcement. “Detection of adenomas during colonoscopy is an important quality metric. The addition of AI can increase the quality of colonoscopies, potentially improving diagnosis and outcomes for colon cancer patients.”

70,Heart Patch Helps Grow New Vessels Post Myocardial Infarct,"Researchers at the Pohang University of Science & Technology (POSTECH) in South Korea have developed a hydrogel patch system that allows for sophisticated sequential release of growth factors that stimulate angiogenesis. The sequential cascade of growth factors mimics the natural process in the body and the researchers hope that the technology could provide regenerative efficacy in ischemic disease, such as myocardial infarction.

Ischemic disease poses a huge chronic burden on patients and healthcare providers. Treatments that can help to restore blood flow to ischemic tissue represent a promising way to help reduce or reverse the damage caused by ischemic disease. Therefore, researchers are working on a variety of clever ways to achieve this.

However, blood vessel growth, known as angiogenesis, is somewhat complex, involving different growth factors that are active at different stages of the process. Simply delivering one growth factor, or several all at once, is unlikely to result in functional and mature blood vessels. Therefore, delivering different growth factors to the affected area at different times is a more promising approach.

This latest technology developed at POSTECH rises to this challenge. It involves microparticles made using mussel adhesive protein and hyaluronic acid. The researchers loaded the particles with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), which is involved in late-stage angiogenesis.

The team then suspended the particles in a viscous and adhesive hydrogel, also containing mussel adhesive protein, and blended endothelial growth factor (VEGF) into the gel, an early stage angiogenic growth factor. The finished gel allows for sequential release of VEGF and PDGF in a way that provides enhanced angiogenic efficacy when it is administered as a patch on the surface of ischemic tissues or as a bioglue. The gel releases VEGF first, to kick start angiogenesis, and then PDGF later to help the growing vessels to mature.

So far, the POSTECH researchers have tested the gel in rat models of myocardial infarction and skin damage. They observed that it could stimulate the growth of functional vasculature and had regenerative efficacy in ischemic tissue.

“We have developed a new platform that can efficiently deliver angiogenic factors spatiotemporally by using the formulation property of mussel adhesive protein, an original biomaterial,” said Hyung Joon Cha, a researcher involved in the study, via a press release. “This platform can play a key role in the neovascularization treatment market as it uses biocompatible biomaterials that are harmless to the human body.”

78,Opinion: H.R. 3’s international reference pricing misses the mark,"The White House and Congress have declared that reining in Medicare prescription drug costs to help older adults and people with disabilities is a top priority. But one drug pricing strategy on the table would have an outsized negative impact on people with Alzheimer’s disease and decimate research trying to find effective treatments for it.

This strategy, known as international reference pricing, ties the price that Medicare pays for some drugs to those paid by other countries. The idea was first introduced as a model for Medicare Part B drugs by then-HHS Secretary Alex Azar in 2018. The next year, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s drug pricing plan, known as the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act (H.R. 3), significantly expanded the scope to allow federal government use of foreign price controls in direct negotiations with pharmaceutical companies for the cost of 250 prescription medicines in Medicare Part B and Part D. It also extended the negotiated price to insurers and the commercial market at large.

Not to be outdone, the Trump administration took another swing at international reference pricing with its “most favored nations” executive order that promised to lower drug prices even further.

advertisement

Recently reintroduced, H.R. 3 may be voted on in the House of Representatives as early as May.

All international reference pricing proposals share a common flaw: They import to the United States the use of discriminatory cost-effectiveness standards that other governments use. Many of the referenced countries, such as the United Kingdom, Canada, and Greece, make drug reimbursement and coverage decisions based on cost-effectiveness assessments tied to the quality-adjusted life year (QALY).

advertisement

QALY assessments assign a value to the patient population a treatment is intended for. These assessments are based on the perceived value of living with a given condition in comparison to being in “perfect health.” By definition, QALYs undervalue treatments for populations that have fewer expected years of life left or shorter life spans than the overall population. In short, if a therapeutic treats a condition for a group that is sicker, older, or includes people with disabilities, or is focused on a population that has historically faced inequities in society and in the health care system, the treatment is assessed as being less valuable. By concluding that a treatment is not cost-effective, payers can justify restricting access by not covering it or using management techniques that effectively restrict access to it.

In 2019, the National Council on Disability (NCD), an independent federal agency, cautioned against relying on the QALY because it would undermine the Affordable Care Act and major U.S. disability and civil rights laws, including the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. Earlier this month, the NCD sent a letter to the Congressional Budget Office expressing its concern with the agency’s use of QALYs to score H.R. 3. It stated, “This makes light of the fact that the QALY assigns a lower value to the lives of people with disabilities and chronic illnesses. It also ignores the fact that countries that rely on the QALY to set drug prices have restricted or denied patients with disabilities access to effective drugs used to treat chronic conditions and to breakthrough medications.”

In 2020, the Democratic National Committee platform stated that, “Democrats will ensure that people with disabilities are never denied coverage based on the use of quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) indexes.”

Given clear statements like these, we believe that policies relying on QALY-driven international pricing metrics should be prohibited, not embraced.

When applied to Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, QALY-based cost-effectiveness analyses present the ultimate moral quandary due to older age and health status. Of the 6.2 million Americans age 65 and older living with Alzheimer’s, one-third are over age 75 and another one-third are over age 85, meaning Alzheimer’s medicines would be expected to receive lower QALY scores. In addition, QALYs generally don’t recognize the significant burden of Alzheimer’s disease and other types of dementia on family caregivers and society, which means they also don’t recognize the value of treatments that alleviate these burdens.

Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias are a critical area of unmet medical need. The failure rate for therapies in the clinical pipeline to treat them is a staggering 98.5%. And in the ten years before H.R. 3 was introduced, 87 clinical programs investing in and researching Alzheimer’s disease were closed.

Federal funding for aging and Alzheimer’s research by the National Institutes of Health has gone from $448 million in 2011 to $3.1 billion in 2021. This investment is essential and should be increased. But 70% of translational research on Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias continues to be funded by pharmaceutical and biotech companies.

Given the risks of investing in medical breakthroughs for neurological conditions, companies need successful products to underwrite and subsidize the investment into new areas of this research. A new analysis by our organizations, Vital Transformation and the Alliance for Aging Research, shows that implementing international reference pricing in the U.S. would decimate the clinical development of therapies for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias and drastically reduce the revenue that helps support this critical research.

More than 30 organizations agree that Congress should keep international reference pricing proposals out of drug pricing reform legislation.

There are positive components of H.R. 3, including proposals to cap and smooth out-of-pocket costs for Medicare Part D beneficiaries. These proposals — which have received support from Democrats and Republicans alike — promote affordability and lower patient costs without restricting access to the care they need.

We share policymakers’ interest in reducing health care costs. But international reference pricing misses the mark and it’s time to let it go for good.

80,"How blackouts, fires, and a pandemic are driving shortages of pipette tips — and hobbling science","How blackouts, fires, and a pandemic are driving shortages of pipette tips — and hobbling science

The humble pipette tip is tiny, cheap, and utterly essential to science. It powers research into new medicines, Covid-19 diagnostics, and every blood test ever run.

It is also, ordinarily, abundant — a typical bench scientist might grab dozens every day.

But now, a series of ill-timed breaks along the pipette tip supply chain — spurred by blackouts, fires, and pandemic-related demand — have created a global shortage that is threatening nearly every corner of the scientific world.

advertisement

The pipette tip shortage is already endangering programs across the country that screen newborn babies for potentially deadly conditions, like the inability to digest sugars in breast milk. It is threatening universities’ experiments on stem cell genetics. And it is forcing biotech companies working to develop new drugs to consider prioritizing certain experiments over others.

Right now, there’s no sign that the shortage will end soon — and if it gets worse, scientists might have to start postponing experiments or even abandoning parts of their work.

advertisement

“The idea of being able to do science without them is laughable,” said Gabrielle Bostwick, a lab manager at California-based synthetic biology startup Octant Bio.

Of all the scientists unnerved by the shortage, researchers responsible for screening infants have been the most organized and outspoken.

Public health laboratories screen infants within hours of their delivery for dozens of genetic conditions. Some, like phenylketonuria and MCAD deficiency, require doctors to immediately change how they’re caring for the baby. Even just delays in the screening process has resulted in some infant deaths, according to a 2013 investigation.

Each child’s screening requires about 30 to 40 pipette tips to complete the dozens of diagnostic tests, and thousands of children are born each day in the United States.

As early as February, these labs were making it clear they did not have the supplies they needed. Labs in 14 states have less than a month’s worth of pipette tips left, according to the Association of Public Health Laboratories. The group was so concerned that it has, for months, pressured the federal government — including the White House — to prioritize the pipette tip needs of newborn screening programs. So far, the organization says, nothing has changed; the White House told STAT that the government is working on several ways to increase the availability of tips.

In some jurisdictions, the plastics shortage has “almost caused parts of the newborn screening programs to shut down,” said Susan Tanksley, a branch manager in the Texas health department’s laboratory services section, during a February meeting of a federal advisory committee on newborn screening. (Tankskey and the state health department did not respond to a request for comment.)

Some states are receiving batches of tips with just a day left to spare, leaving them little choice but to beg other labs for backup, according to Scott Shone, the director of North Carolina’s state public health laboratory. Shone said he had heard of some public health officials calling around “saying, ‘I’m running out tomorrow, can you overnight me something?’ Because the vendor says it’s coming, but I don’t know.’”

“Trusting when that vendor says, ‘Three days before you run out, we’re going to get you another month’s supply’ — it’s anxiety,” he said.

Many labs have turned to jury-rigged alternatives. Some are washing tips and then reusing them, increasing the potential risk of cross-contamination. Others are running newborn screenings in batches, which could increase the time it takes to deliver results.

So far, these solutions have been enough. “We are not in a situation where there’s immediate jeopardy to newborns,” Shone added.

Beyond labs that screen newborn babies, biotech companies working on new therapeutics and university laboratories doing basic research are also feeling the squeeze.

Scientists at PRA Health Sciences, a contract research organization that is working on clinical trials for hepatitis B and several Bristol Myers Squibb drug candidates, say supplies running out is a constant threat — though they haven’t yet had to formally delay any readouts.

“At times, it gets down to one rack of tips sitting on the back shelf, and we’re like ‘Oh my goodness,’” said Jason Neat, the executive director of bioanalytical services at PRA Health’s lab in Kansas.

The shortage has become alarming enough at Arrakis Therapeutics, a Waltham, Mass. company working on potential treatments for cancer, neurological conditions, and rare diseases, that its head of RNA biology, Kathleen McGinness, created a dedicated Slack channel to help her colleagues share solutions for conserving pipette tips.

“We had a realization that this was not acute,” she said of the channel, #tipsfortips. “A lot of the team have been very proactive about solutions, but we didn’t have a centralized place to share that.”

Most of the biotech companies interviewed by STAT said they were taking steps to conserve limited pipettes and, thus far, have not had to halt work.

Octant’s scientists, for example, are being very selective about using filtered pipette tips. These tips — which are particularly difficult to source lately — offer samples an extra layer of protection against outside contaminants, but can’t be sanitized and reused. So they’re dedicating them to activities that might be particularly sensitive.

“If you’re not paying attention to what’s running out, you could very easily run out of things,” said Danielle de Jong, a lab manager at the University of Florida’s Whitney Laboratory; the lab she works in studies how stem cells work in small marine animals related to jellyfish that can regenerate parts of themselves.

Scientists at the Whitney Laboratory have, at times, bailed out their neighbors when supply orders didn’t arrive in time; de Jong has even caught herself eyeing other labs’ shelves for any unused pipette tips, just in case her lab need to borrow some.

“I’ve been working in a lab for 21 years,” she said. “I’ve never encountered supply chain issues like this. Ever.”

There’s no singular explanation for the shortage.

The sudden explosion of Covid-19 tests last year — each of which relies on pipette tips — certainly played a role. But the effects of natural disasters and other freak accidents further up the supply chain have also cascaded down to laboratory benches.

The devastating statewide blackouts in Texas, which killed more than 100 people, also broke a critical link in the complex pipette supply chain. Those power outages forced ExxonMobil and other companies to temporarily close plants in the state — some of which made polypropylene resin, the raw material for pipette tips.

According to a March presentation, ExxonMobil’s Houston-area plant was the company’s second-largest producer of polypropylene in 2020; only its Singapore plant made more. Two of ExxonMobil’s three biggest polyethylene plants were also located in Texas. (In April 2020, ExxonMobil even increased polypropylene production at two U.S.-based plants.)

“After the winter storm in February this year, it is estimated that over 85% of the polypropylene production capacity in the U.S. was adversely affected due to a variety of issues such as broken pipes at the production plants as well as the loss of electricity and vital raw materials needed to restart production,” said a spokesperson for Total, another Houston-based oil and gas company that produces polypropylene.

But supply chains have been stressed since last summer — well before February’s deep freeze. Lower-than-usual amounts of raw materials isn’t the only factor that’s throttling supply chains — and pipette tips aren’t the only plastic-based piece of lab gear that’s been in short supply.

A manufacturing plant fire also knocked out 80% of the country’s supply of the containers for used pipette tips and other sharp objects, according to a document posted on the University of Pittsburgh’s website.

And in July, U.S. Customs and Border Protection began blocking products from a major glove manufacturer suspected of forced labor practices. (CBP issued the findings of its investigation last month.)

“What we’re seeing is really anything in the plastics-related side of the business — polypropylene, specifically — is either on backorder, or in high demand,” said PRA Health Sciences’ Neat.

The demand is so high that the price of some scarce supplies has gone up, according to Tiffany Harmon, a procurement administrator at PRA Health Sciences’ bioanalytics lab in Kansas.

The company is now paying 300% more for gloves through its usual supplier. And PRA’s pipette tip orders now have an extra fee tacked on. One pipette tip manufacturer, which announced a new 4.75% surcharge last month, told its customers that the move was necessary because the price of the raw plastic materials had almost doubled.

Adding to the uncertainty for laboratory scientists is the distributors’ process for determining which orders will be filled first — the workings of which few scientists said they fully understood.

“The lab community has been asking from the beginning to help us understand how these decisions are made,” said Shone, who referred to vendors’ formulas for determining allocations as “black box magic.”

STAT contacted more than a dozen companies that manufacture or sell pipette tips, including Corning, Eppendorf, Fisher Scientific, VWR, and Rainin. Just two responded.

Corning declined to comment, citing proprietary agreements with its customers. MilliporeSigma, meanwhile, said that it allocates pipettes on a first-come, first-serve basis.

“Since the outbreak of the pandemic, the entire life science industry has experienced unprecedented demand for Covid-19 related products, including MilliporeSigma,” a spokesperson for the major scientific supplies distribution company told STAT in an emailed statement. “We are working 24/7 to meet this increased demand for these products and as well as those used in scientific discovery.”

Despite attempts to bolster the supply chain, it’s not clear how much longer the shortages will last.

Corning received $15 million from the Department of Defense to make 684 million more pipette tips per year at its facility in Durham, N.C. Tecan, too, is building new manufacturing facilities with $32 million from the CARES Act.

But that won’t fix the problem if plastics production remains lower than expected. And neither of those projects will actually be able to produce pipette tips before the fall of 2021, anyway.

Until then, laboratory managers and scientists are bracing for more shortages of pipettes and just about anything else.

“We started this pandemic short of swabs and media. And then we had shortages of reagents. And then we had shortages of plastics. And then we had shortages of reagents again,” North Carolina’s Shone said. “It’s like Groundhog Day.”

Update: After this story was published, MilliporeSigma explained that it uses a first-come, first-serve system for allocating pipette tips, not the four-tier system it had first described. The story now reflects the company’s update.",www.statnews.com

83,"Biogen to expand access to its ALS drug, but move may come too late for some patients","Biogen to expand access to its ALS drug, but move may come too late for some patients

After weeks of controversy, Biogen (BIIB) has agreed to provide an experimental drug for combating ALS to a small group of very sick patients under a so-called expanded access program. But the move may come too late for the woman who pushed the company to take this step.

The decision follows sustained pressure by ALS patients, notably Lisa Stockman Mauriello, a health care communications executive who has a rare and fast-moving form of the neurological disease. This subset of patients typically has a very short life span, but no treatment options. So with help from supporters, she mounted a high-profile campaign to convince Biogen to provide access to its drug as quickly as possible.

But Biogen repeatedly refused, citing concerns that providing the drug to patients outside of an ongoing study would be unfair to participants who were given a placebo. As a result, the campaign not only cast an uncomfortable spotlight on Biogen, but also highlighted the quandaries surrounding expanded access programs in an era when innovative new medicines are spurring patients to become more assertive.

“Answering questions about access for new medicines outside of clinical studies is neither simple nor fast. Among the ethical imperatives in any access program are assuring that all patients receive equal treatment and priority and preserving the integrity of ongoing studies,” the company wrote in a statement. “Addressing these imperatives takes time and requires careful thought.”

In what amounts to a Solomon-like approach, Biogen will offer its drug, called tofersen, to these patients starting in July after a key, late-stage study is complete and participants are no longer on a placebo. Once the biotech determines the study data shows the drug is safe and effective, the program will be opened to a broader group of patients with the gene mutation. This is expected to occur by this coming fall.

The gesture was greeted with decidedly mixed reactions.

Stockman Mauriello, 51, who was diagnosed in February with the rare form of ALS and given only a few months to live, issued a statement that underscored both frustration and gratitude.

“We are not even sure how to feel right now. We are pleased that our efforts have contributed to some people with ALS getting access to tofersen faster than they would have otherwise. Unfortunately, it still falls short for patients like me who are deteriorating rapidly,” she wrote. “For us, this is a death sentence because we most likely will not make it to mid-July when the tofersen expanded access will start, and if we do, we will be in such bad shape that we may not see any benefit.”

She and her husband, along with other supporters, had attempted to convince Biogen to add this small subset of patients to the trial and randomize them. That would allow some patients to receive the drug while others would be given a placebo. In this way, they argued, Biogen would avoid ethical questions and at least some patients with the rare form of ALS might benefit.

“This is not going to help the dying patients. They’ll be dead before mid-July. I don’t mean to sound callous, but this is the uncomfortable reality,” her husband, Robert Mauriello, told us. “She can’t walk to the bathroom by herself. If she’s deteriorated in the last couple of months, where will she be in three months? I think its untenable and unethical to have people wait that long.

“Randomizing this group for this acute need, at least until July when no one is on placebo, would be a tweak to their plan that would get around their concerns and save a dozen lives,” he continued. “Lisa may get a placebo. That could certainly happen. It’s in G-d’s hands then. But I’d rather have a two out of three chance of getting the drug then getting a zero chance.”

For its part, the ALS Foundation said in a statement that “all companies should have expanded access programs to help people with ALS access experimental treatments and this is a positive step forward. These treatments are still experimental, however, and we do not know if they work. What is most important is that we get effective treatments to everyone with ALS as soon as possible. That means we need more and faster clinical trials and a faster Food and Drug Administration.”

The episode underscores some of the ongoing challenges posed by expanded access programs, which are sometimes referred to as compassionate use. The process requires a physician to submit a request to a drug company, and for regulators to sign off on providing a medicine.

Historically, the FDA has approved 99% of all requests, but critics complained the program is cumbersome and arbitrary. In 2018, Congress passed the “right-to-try” law, which does not require a drug maker to seek endorsement from the FDA. But drug makers — which may worry about supplies or the impact on clinical trials — still are not required to provide a medicine.

This particular case highlights some critical unresolved issues about the timing of an expanded access program when patients have a very fast-moving disease, according to Holly Fernandez-Lynch, an assistant professor of medical ethics at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.

“It’s a hard case because it involves fairness to those who’ve agreed to participate in a study in which they might not receive toferson, as well as fairness to those who couldn’t participate – not because they’re meaningfully different from those in the study, but because the timing just worked out differently for them,” she explained.

Although the issue might be addressed by randomizing people seeking a drug through expanded access, she noted randomization is typically used for scientific reasons or when the manufacturer has limited supplies of the drug being tested. But waiting to provide expanded access until study participants are off a placebo can cause what she called “a pretty significant gap” in the time needed to gain access.

Part of the problem, Fernandez-Lynch explained, is the ongoing uncertainty surrounding FDA reactions to side effects among patients who are given a drug as part of an expanded access program. The agency has told drug makers “not to worry too much about adverse events… but there still seems to be a lingering concern that any hiccup whatsoever could slow things down,” she continued.

With situations such as tofersen, in which days and weeks matter, additional detail from the FDA and regulators elsewhere might add needed clarity. “Overall, I think Biogen’s plan is a reasonable compromise on a very difficult issue,” Ferandez-Lynch concluded, “although it doesn’t plug the hole completely.”

Not everyone was sanguine.

“Biogen’s plans are a grudging acceptance of the errors of their ways,” said Gregg Gonsalves, an epidemiology professor at the Yale School of Public Health. He noted Bristol Myers Squibb made its HIV drugs available tens of thousands of patients before late-stage studies were done, because expanded access was crafted to work as a pathway to access for those who did not qualify for the studies.

“Biogen needs to commit to broad access to its entire ALS portfolio as their drugs enter a Phase 3 study, not after they are completed,” he wrote us. “It’s good to know they are offering limited access to some patients in July 2021 and others later this year, but this is still an unnecessary delay. If we could do it in HIV/AIDS 30 years ago, Biogen can do it today.”

Meanwhile, Stockman Mauriello’s physician, Neil Shneider, a neurologist at Columbia University who is also a clinical investigator in the late-stage tofersen trial, offered a sobering view.

“I’m very glad Biogen found a way to offer an expanded access program to patients like Lisa. I just fear it will be too late for her. Three months for her is a long time. She was only diagnosed three months ago and already is markedly impaired by her disease,” he told us. “I’m hoping she can still benefit, but the longer she has to wait, the less chance she has of benefiting. I’m disappointed for her, but glad her efforts have led to this decision to make the drug available.

“But I hope it will be a lesson and example for other companies, large and small, in ALS and other diseases that are fatal for which patients have very little choice. I hope that companies will consider offering unproven therapies in their pipeline in a way that doesn’t undermine trials. That’s the ultimate obligation of a company,” Shneider continued. “For now, I will apply for expanded access for Lisa this July.”",www.statnews.com
84,"A mask break: Federal health officials say vaccinated people can doff face coverings when outside, away from crowds","People who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19 no longer need to wear masks while outside in uncrowded areas or in small groups, federal health officials said Tuesday as part of updated guidance.

The federal health officials urged people — even those who are vaccinated — to continue wearing masks in indoor settings like the grocery store or houses of worship as a way to protect others who are not yet vaccinated and to reduce transmission. They also said people should continue to use face coverings in crowded areas even if outdoors, at events like sports games or concerts where distancing is more difficult. While the available Covid-19 vaccines are incredibly powerful at preventing illness and are cutting transmission, some people do contract the virus after being immunized. (Researchers are still trying to understand just how efficiently people who have these so-called breakthrough infections can transmit the virus to others; it’s possible the vaccines cut down on how contagious they are.)

At a briefing Tuesday, Rochelle Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, noted that experts over the past year had been focused on what Americans shouldn’t do. “Today I’m going to tell you some of the things you can do, if you are fully vaccinated,” she said in announcing the updated mask recommendations.

advertisement

The message from federal health officials is likely to lead to policy changes around the country. Already, some states have lifted mask mandates entirely as their cases counts have dropped after the devastating winter surge.

Some public health experts had been urging government officials to make such a recommendation on outdoor mask-wearing not only because outdoor transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is such a rare event, but also to signal to the public that with vaccines comes greater freedoms. More places in the country are reaching the point where they have more vaccine supply available than people eager to get shots, a circumstance that reflects not only resistance, for some, but also access issues, like how easy it is for people to make appointments and get to an administration site.

People are considered fully vaccinated two weeks after their final dose of the vaccine if they receive the two-shot immunizations from Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna, or two weeks after getting the single shot from Johnson & Johnson.

In Covid’s grip, India gasps for air: ‘If there is an apocalypse, this has to be one’

MUMBAI — Working hard to keep her composure, Lavanya Sharma tweeted a short video on April 25. “Please please please help,” the teenage girl from New Delhi’s Uttam Nagar neighborhood wrote atop her post as her mother lay gasping for breath and her oximeter blinked a dangerously low reading of 52/100.

Sharma’s frantic calls for help didn’t get an official response until the next day, when an ambulance finally arrived to take her mother to the hospital.

This harrowing tale highlights the plight of millions of Indians who are being pushed to the brink by the country’s ferocious second wave of the pandemic.

advertisement

I know what Sharma is going through, having seen family members and friends laid low, and even killed, by Covid-19. A neighbor, in his 60s, died while on a ventilator. A political leader who helped me get my first home in Mumbai in 1996 died two days ago from a cardiac arrest that occurred as he was getting treated for Covid-19. Everyone in my sister’s family was sickened by the infection at the same time, but they appear to have recovered. My in-law’s family had it tougher, with two sons ages 28 and 31 needing oxygen in intensive care units for several days. Others, desperately needing treatment, were unable to get into hospitals.

In cities big and small, hospitals are too full to accept new patients and diagnostic centers take up to three days or more to do chest scans of those who might have Covid-19. Doctors and hospital staff are completely exhausted.

advertisement

Social media is flooded with passionate pleas for oxygen cylinders and concentrators. WhatsApp groups are filled with messages as friends and families scramble to access oxygen, remdesivir, tocilizumab, steroids, and other therapies. In a country where drug regulatory oversight is suspect, indiscriminate sale of fake drugs is a huge problem.

As someone who has covered the pharmaceutical and health care industries for more than two decades, I get calls for help into the wee hours of the night from family members, friends, and even acquaintances. Fake therapies are something I constantly worry about as I try to use my contacts to help people looking for hospital beds, medicines, or oxygen cylinders. Sometimes I’ve been able to help, but the calls are so many and the problems so big that often I cannot.

The merciless spread of Covid-19 is driving families to extreme limits. People with the means to do so are shelling out on the black market as much as 10 times the cost of a single vial of remdesivir. Others, many of whom are being pushed to bankruptcy, resign themselves to destiny.

Television stations routinely dish out painful stories of families who lost loved ones. “I have money, I have everything but I could not save my sister,” says a young person who cried inconsolably in a TV news report.

Hospitals don’t have enough beds for those seeking help, and even if they do, the shortage of oxygen is an agonizing death sentence for patients who can’t get access to it. Video clips are making the rounds showing people dying even as they are hurriedly wheeled on stretchers into hospitals.

Ambulances are being crammed with the dead — as many as 20 bodies at a time — on their way to crematoria and burial grounds. Funeral pyres glowing 24/7 are a constant reminder of the staggering death toll.

If there is an apocalypse, this has to be one.

Covid-19 is spreading at a terrifying pace, now averaging 350,000 new infections and nearly 3,000 deaths a day. As I write this, the official number of deaths is nearly 198,000.

Public health experts, however, suggest that the number of deaths could be several times higher, and possibly in the millions. They point to the glaring mismatch in deaths attributed to Covid-19 in government files and the actual number of deaths registered at crematoria and burial grounds.

The seething rage at the failure of the government and its precipitous public health catastrophe is giving way to an uneasy sense of desolation and helplessness.

India’s early success in nearly flattening the Covid-19 curve in 2020 may be the cause of the current calamity. Despite a rickety and funding-starved health care infrastructure, the country’s ability to manage the first wave of Covid-19 looked laudable as the United States, Canada, and countries in Europe reeled under second and third waves of the pandemic. Then things went awry. The turnaround raised false hopes that the virus had run out of steam in India and the country would be spared a second wave.

Virologists, modeling experts, and prominent epidemiologists appeared on TV shows to suggest that herd immunity may have kicked in, with testing in some cities showing the existence of anti-Covid antibodies in up to half of communities. Some professed that Indians have stronger-than-average immune systems, or they may be spared from Covid-19 by cross protection from other infectious diseases. A few invoked evolutionary biology and said the virus will not kill all its hosts and endanger its own existence.

Then India’s hyper-nationalism took over. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and senior leaders from his Bharatiya Janata Party, who thrive on overwhelming popularity, took no time to claim victory in the fight against the virus. Election rallies attracted soaring crowds. As Modi and Amit Shah, the two top leaders, brazenly took off their masks during their incessant campaigns, those in the crowds followed and dropped theirs.

Further fueling new cases was Kumbh Mela, a gargantuan confluence of Hindu pilgrims who gathered for a holy dip in the Ganges River. As many as 2.5 million people took part, with scant attention to Covid-19 safety protocols. By the time an avalanche of criticism cut short the festival, the virus had infected thousands of pilgrims, who took it home to their neighborhoods and villages.

Efforts to crank up a badly hobbled economy also added to the spread. Business and manufacturing activities began reopening in May 2020 as ministers projected a V-shaped economic recovery while scientific messaging to keep wearing masks and follow social distancing took a beating. Masks, which had become part of public life in India for most part of 2020, gradually disappeared from faces.

As countries issue advisories suspending flight operations to and from India, the country’s dominance as a global vaccines player is in question. In January 2021, the Indian government authorized two vaccines for emergency use against Covid-19 and committed to help a host of countries vaccinate their residents. The pandemic’s second wave has dealt those plans a hard blow.

The Modi administration has expanded the scope of vaccination, now making the jabs available to anyone over age 18. While this is the right move, it has led to a shortfall of vaccines and slowed the pace of the vaccination drive. While vaccines are seen as the most effective intervention to cut the spread of the virus, there are now serious doubts on how efficiently can India roll out its program.

In 2002, India unveiled “Incredible India,” a high-octane advertising campaign aimed at drawing international tourists to the country of contrasts, cultures, palaces, and forests. Though the campaign remains, it is now overshadowed by the putrid smoke pouring from funeral pyres, the gasps for breath of those afflicted with Covid-19, and the cries of the millions of family members and friends who have lost loved ones to a pandemic wave that could have been prevented.

Unless we get out of this soon, I fear that we will be left with “Incompetent India” — or worse.

86,Biden administration will allow nearly all providers to prescribe buprenorphine,"Biden administration will allow nearly all providers to prescribe buprenorphine

WASHINGTON — The Biden administration on Tuesday announced it would move forward with a dramatic deregulation of addiction medicine first proposed by the Trump administration in January.

The change would allow almost any prescriber to treat patients using the drug buprenorphine, the most effective medication for opioid addiction. Currently, doctors, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners must undergo a separate training and apply for a waiver before they’re allowed to prescribe the drug to patients.

For years, many addiction physicians and public health advocates have argued that the “X-waiver,” as the special buprenorphine license is known, poses a barrier to basic care for patients with opioid addiction. In particular, many have argued that if a doctor can prescribe potentially addictive prescription pain drugs, they should also be able to prescribe the medicine used to treat the addiction.

advertisement

“Increases in overdose deaths emphasize the need to expand access to evidence-based treatments, including buprenorphine that can be prescribed in office-based settings,” Rachel Levine, the assistant secretary for health, said in a statement. “These guidelines provide another tool to help communities respond to the evolving overdose crisis, equipping providers to save lives in their communities.”

The move comes amid a worse-than-ever drug overdose crisis, which has taken a dire turn amid the Covid-19 pandemic. More than 87,000 Americans died of overdoses during the 12-month period that ended in September 2020, according to estimates from the Centers for Disease Control. Data for the full 2020 calendar year isn’t available yet, but most addiction policy officials expect the death toll will climb even higher.

advertisement

The Trump administration first announced it would move to deregulate buprenorphine on Jan. 14, the administration’s final week in office. The Biden administration froze the proposal along with most other regulations issued late in the Trump administration soon after taking power.

During a confirmation hearing in February, health secretary Xavier Becerra hinted that the administration didn’t necessarily oppose the Trump-era proposal, suggesting it wasn’t legally sound.

“The president’s goal was to get it right,” he told Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.). “We don’t want to end up in court and delayed even further.”

The Biden administration’s new policy, issued as Department of Health and Human Services practice guidelines, goes slightly further than the Trump administration’s. In light of the announcement, physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse midwives will be allowed to treat up to 30 patients with buprenorphine.

Those providers will still need to submit a notice of intent to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration that they intend to prescribe buprenorphine, Levine said, though they’ll now be exempted from training requirements.

The announcement represents the Biden administration’s first major action on drug overdoses. President Biden campaigned aggressively on addiction issues, specifically pledging to repeal the X-waiver and make treatment more widely available.

The Department of Health and Human Services estimated in January that just 66,000 of the country’s roughly 1 million physicians, and 25,000 non-physician prescribers like NPs or PAs, have a waiver to prescribe buprenorphine.

The Biden administration’s action is likely to win approval from major medical groups. In January, when the Trump administration announced its highly similar proposal, it earned the quick endorsement of the American Medical Association and a bipartisan group of lawmakers on Capitol Hill.

A separate effort to fully repeal the X-waiver is still pending before Congress. Its author, Rep. Paul Tonko (D-N.Y.), lauded the Trump administration change in January and has since called for Biden to endorse his bill, known as the Mainstreaming Addiction Treatment Act.

While some drug policy officials have resisted the change in the past, citing buprenorphine’s status as a controlled substance, Trump officials argued in January that rising overdose rates compelled them to act.

“Many people will say this has gone too far, but I believe more people will say this has not gone far enough,” said Brett Giroir, who served as the Trump administration’s assistant secretary for health. “This is a measured, logical, appropriate, evidence-based, and patient-centered intervention that may save tens of thousands of lives.”",www.statnews.com

91,AHA News: Salt Sensitivity May Increase Risk of High Blood Pressure,"People who are salt-sensitive may have an increased risk of developing high blood pressure, according to a study that points to the need for better genetic testing for sodium sensitivity.

Scientists already knew high salt sensitivity is more common among people with high blood pressure, which is a leading preventable risk factor for cardiovascular disease. But researchers wanted to investigate whether salt sensitivity caused hypertension or happened as result of it.

The new study, published Monday in the American Heart Association journal Hypertension, determined the salt-sensitivity level of 1,604 Chinese adults by putting them on a seven-day low-salt diet, followed by a seven-day high-salt diet. After following the participants for an average of 7.4 years, researchers found that people with high sodium sensitivity were 43% more likely to develop high blood pressure than those with moderate sensitivity.

The findings suggest sodium sensitivity is a cause, not a consequence, of high blood pressure, said study author Dr. Jiang He.

""This really supports the idea that we need to pay more attention to reducing salt intake in the general population,"" said He, professor of epidemiology and director of the Translational Science Institute at Tulane University in New Orleans.

In addition to helping prevent high blood pressure, cutting back on salt has an added benefit, according to past studies: It reduces stiff arteries, a condition associated with heart attack and stroke.

The new research was part of the Genetic Epidemiology Network of Salt Sensitivity, or GenSalt study, which included genetic testing. Researchers said it was the largest diet-feeding study to test blood pressure sodium sensitivity and resistance.

However, the genetic aspect of the study was ""very challenging,"" He said.

""We were not successful in identifying either genetic variants or other biomarkers for salt sensitivity. We clearly need more research in this area to identify simple ways to identify people who are salt-sensitive.""

The findings were also limited by the study being conducted solely in Chinese adults. A much larger study is needed in the U.S. that includes a diverse group of people who may be more sensitive to salt, He said.

""It's an important study that took the difficult, unusual step of tracking blood pressure for years, which gives more credence to their findings. It's a good first step,"" said Dr. Gordon Harold Williams, who was not involved in the research.

The second step – developing genetic tests to find out which salt-sensitive people have increased risk for high blood pressure – will be more difficult, said Williams, who heads the Hormonal Mechanisms of Cardiovascular Injury Laboratory at Harvard's Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.

""It would be fairly easy to do this study if you did it with your eye color. But there are so many different mechanisms that can lead to salt sensitivity of blood pressure, so many environmental factors that can influence what a particular gene variance does in a given individual,"" said Williams, also a professor at Harvard Medical School.

But Williams holds out hope that with enough research, scientists soon will be able to test people for higher salt-sensitivity risks just as they routinely test for genetic variations to guide cancer diagnosis and treatment.

""I think this study and this topic will energize people,"" he said. ""Hopefully, on the horizon, we will have personalized medicine for this, too.""

92,"COVID-19 Could Raise Odds for Heart Failure, Even in Those With No Prior Heart Risk","By Amy Norton HealthDay Reporter

In rare cases, people hospitalized for COVID-19 can develop heart failure, even if their hearts were previously healthy, new research shows.

The researchers found that of over 6,400 COVID-19 patients at their hospital, 0.6% newly developed heart failure. That included eight patients — mostly relatively young men — with no history of heart disease or risk factors for it.

Heart failure arises when the heart cannot pump blood effectively enough to meet the body's needs, which results in symptoms like breathlessness, rapid heart rate, fluid buildup, and swelling in the legs and feet.

Doctors have known that COVID-19 patients can develop heart failure, but it has not been clear how frequently that happens.

""That's the question that prompted this study,"" said senior researcher Dr. Anuradha Lala, director of heart failure research at Mount Sinai's Icahn School of Medicine, in New York City.

Based on the findings, she said, new heart failure appears to be uncommon and usually strikes patients with a history of heart disease or stroke, or with risk factors for heart trouble, such as high blood pressure or diabetes. But a handful of patients developed heart failure despite having no risk factors. Exactly why is unclear.

""For now, the mechanisms remain elusive,"" Lala said.

There could be various scenarios playing out, according to Lala. When patients do have a history of heart problems or conditions like high blood pressure, she said, it's possible that COVID-19 ""pushes them over the edge"" toward heart failure.

For some, it might be the stress of being severely ill in the hospital. But the body's inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, could also play a role.

Dr. Biykem Bozkurt is a professor of medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, in Houston, and a member of the American College of Cardiology's Science & Quality Committee.

She said that in patients with established heart disease, the physiological stress of a severe case of COVID-19 — including less oxygen getting to the heart — may be one factor precipitating new heart failure.

But more often, Bozkurt said, the heart complication may be driven by an overly aggressive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and widespread inflammation in the body.

She said that since the pandemic's start, it's become clear that COVID-19 can have various cardiac complications: Some patients develop heart attack symptoms, blood clots or an inflammation of the heart muscle called myocarditis.

With heart failure, some symptoms (like breathlessness) do overlap with COVID-19. But doctors have additional ways to pinpoint heart failure, Lala said: They include blood tests that look for elevations in a protein called BNP, and imaging tests that detect certain structural or functional abnormalities in the heart.

How do these patients ultimately fare after they go home from the hospital?

""I think it's a spectrum,"" Bozkurt said. If patients show an improvement in symptoms and objective measures of heart structure and function, that bodes well.

Lala said it's not clear whether, for some patients with new heart failure, any structural abnormalities in the heart might persist, or whether signs and symptoms could re-emerge.

93,"Raising Legal Age for Tobacco Cuts Teen Smoking, Study Confirms","Raising the legal age for buying tobacco is effective in cutting teen smoking rates, a new study shows.

Researchers compared teen and young adult smoking patterns before and three years after a 2016 California law that increased the legal age for tobacco sales from 18 to 21.

The University of California, Davis team found that the ""T21"" law led to a greater decrease in daily smoking among those ages 18-20 than among those ages 21-23.

""The great news is that the prevalence of 'daily' smoking among 18- to 20-year-olds went from 2.2% in 2016 to nearly zero in 2019,"" said study co-author Susan Stewart, a professor in the division of biostatistics in the Department of Public Health Sciences.

There was no decrease in non-daily smoking.

""A possible reason that we may have seen a decrease in 'daily' smoking, but not 'non-daily' smoking, is that 'daily' smokers are more likely to buy their own cigarettes -- so they are more likely to be impacted by sales restrictions,"" Stewart said in a university news release.

Also, there was no decline in rates of people who were current smokers or who ever smoked, according to the study, which was published recently in the journal Preventive Medicine.

The researchers said possible reasons why there wasn't a drop in all types of smoking behavior after the law include: previous declines in smoking nationwide; enforcement difficulties at the state level; increased use of other products such as e-cigarettes and marijuana; sales outside of retail stores; and other tobacco control policies.

""Most adult tobacco users start smoking cigarettes before the age of 18, when the brain is still developing and is especially susceptible to nicotine and addiction,"" said study author Melanie Dove, an assistant professor in the division of health policy and management in the Department of Public Health Sciences.

""The new T21 law has the potential, over time, of dramatically reducing the number of youth who begin smoking regularly and that's why it is important to track the impact,"" Dove said in the release.

""Future studies should examine the role of e-cigarette use, policy enforcement, as well as online sales,"" said study co-author Dr. Elisa Tong, an internist and associate professor who directs tobacco cessation initiatives at the UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center.

94,Adding Vaping to Smoking Brings Even Worse Respiratory Effects,"So, you're trying desperately to quit smoking, using e-cigarettes while still using traditional cigarettes. Sound like a good idea?

Maybe not, according to a new study that shows that combining vaping with smoking raises the risk for respiratory wheeze and cough.

""To help people quit smoking, FDA-approved medications, such as the nicotine patch or the medication varenicline [brand name Chantix], are preferred,"" said study author Dr. Krishna Reddy. He's an investigator in the division of pulmonary and critical care medicine and the Tobacco Research and Treatment Center at Massachusetts General Hospital, in Boston.

On the other hand, ""people who vape e-cigarettes in an effort to stop smoking tobacco cigarettes should be cautioned against using both and instead should switch over completely from smoking to vaping, with an ultimate goal of stopping vaping as well,"" Reddy said in a hospital news release.

For the study, the researchers analyzed data from nearly 21,000 Americans, aged 12 and older, who took part in a national survey and had no respiratory symptoms when first surveyed in 2015 to 2016.

When surveyed again about a year later, respiratory symptoms were reported by nearly 11% of those who did not use e-cigarettes or tobacco cigarettes, nearly 12% of those who used e-cigarettes only, 17% of those who used tobacco cigarettes only, and nearly 20% of those who used both e-cigarettes and tobacco cigarettes.

The researchers found that dual users were nearly twice as likely to develop respiratory symptoms as exclusive e-cigarette users and just over 1.2 times more likely to have symptoms than exclusive tobacco smokers.

The risk of new respiratory symptoms among people who used e-cigarettes only was not significantly higher than the risk among those who didn't vape or smoke, according to the study published recently in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine.

According to study senior author Dr. Nancy Rigotti, director of the Tobacco Research and Treatment Center, ""This study helps identify how e-cigarettes can best be used to reduce the harms caused by smoking cigarettes. Exclusive e-cigarette use did not increase the risk of new respiratory symptoms while using both products (e-cigarettes and cigarettes) did.""

95,Common Complication of Pregnancy Tied to Higher Stroke Risk Later,"Having preeclampsia during pregnancy significantly increases a woman's future risk of stroke, researchers say.

Preeclampsia happens when a woman with previously normal blood pressure suddenly develops high blood pressure, protein in her urine or other problems after 20 weeks into pregnancy. The condition occurs in about one in 25 pregnancies in the United States, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The new study findings suggest that women who've had preeclampsia require monitoring of their heart health as they age, according to the authors.

""Our study strongly suggests that, for women who have a history of preeclampsia, physicians should consider aggressive treatment of midlife vascular risk factors, including high blood pressure and elevated cholesterol and glucose [blood sugar] levels,"" said Dr. Adam de Havenon, lead author of the study and an assistant professor of neurology at University of Utah Health.

""Doing this could potentially reduce the risk of these women having strokes,"" de Havenon added in a university news release.

Untreated preeclampsia can cause serious complications for mother and child, the study authors noted.

Prior research has found an association between preeclampsia and stroke, but did not follow women as they got older. Nor did it assess stroke risk factors such as high blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar or smoking.

This new study included more than 1,400 white women who were followed for an average of 32 years after giving birth. Of those, 169 had preeclampsia during pregnancy.

The women who had preeclampsia were more likely to be younger, smoke, have higher diastolic blood pressure and receive treatment for high cholesterol than the others being assessed.

Over the follow-up period, 231 of the women in the study had a stroke. After accounting for other risk factors, the University of Utah Health researchers concluded that preeclampsia was independently associated with about a 3.8-fold higher risk of stroke later in life.

The study was published online April 26 in JAMA Network Open.

Further research is needed to learn more about the connection between preeclampsia and stroke. But it appears that preeclampsia may cause more long-term blood vessel damage than previously thought and put women at higher risk for stroke as they get older, according to the researchers.

Study co-author Dr. Lauren Theilen, an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology, said, ""Preeclampsia is a complicated disease involving injury to the lining of the blood vessels. We used to think it just happened while you were pregnant, then it healed afterward. But preeclampsia may be doing lasting damage to the blood vessels.""

96,"Secondhand Smoke Can Raise Odds for Mouth, Throat Cancers","If you live with a smoker, breathing in their smoke could increase your risk of oral cancer by more than 50%, a new analysis shows.

The findings highlight the need for more effective programs to prevent people from being exposed to secondhand smoke, the British authors said.

They analyzed five studies from Asia, Europe, North America and Latin America that included a total of nearly 7,000 people -- including more than 3,400 who were exposed to secondhand smoke.

The researchers found that people who were exposed to secondhand smoke had a 51% higher risk of developing oral cancers (lip, mouth and throat cancers). Exposures of more than 10 or 15 years increased the risk to more than twice that of people not exposed to secondhand smoke.

The findings were published online April 26 in the journal Tobacco Control.

""This systematic review and meta-analysis supports a causal association between secondhand smoke exposure and oral cancer,"" wrote Saman Warnakulasuriya and his colleagues. Warnakulasuriya is a professor of oral medicine at King's College London and WHO Collaborating Centre for Oral Cancer in London.

""Moreover, the analyses of exposure response, including by duration of exposure (more than 10 or 15 years) to secondhand smoke, further supports causal inference,"" the authors said in a journal news release.

A meta-analysis looks for trends across studies.

There are nearly 448,000 new cases of oral cancers and more than 228,000 deaths from the cancers worldwide every year. Major risk factors include tobacco smoking, smokeless tobacco, alcohol consumption, and betel quid chewing (betel nut mixed with tobacco used for chewing; it's used widely throughout Asia).

Tobacco smoking is known to cause oral cancer, but it wasn't clear whether secondhand smoke also causes oral cancer.

Previous research has shown that secondhand smoke exposure causes several diseases, including lung cancer.

Data from 192 countries shows that 33% of male nonsmokers, 35% of female nonsmokers and 40% of children were exposed to secondhand smoke over one year, according to the authors.

97,U.S. to Share Up to 60 Million Doses of AstraZeneca Vaccine,"By Ernie Mundell and Robin Foster HealthDay Reporters

As coronavirus cases surge around the world, the White House said Monday that the United States will share up to 60 million doses of the AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine with other countries.

The announcement came as India's health system showed signs of collapse amid a soaring case count. The AstraZeneca vaccine will be shipped out once it clears federal safety reviews, The New York Times reported.

Biden Administration officials noted that the move will not affect the United States' national vaccination drive.

""We do not need to use AstraZeneca in our fight against COVID,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said during a media briefing, the Washington Post reported.

The latest decision represents a shift for the White House, which has been reluctant to make extra doses of coronavirus vaccine available in large amounts.

Unlike the Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines, AstraZeneca's vaccine has not yet been granted emergency use authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and U.S. officials would not say which countries will receive it once it is approved, the Times reported.

Jen Psaki said about 10 million doses could be released ""in the coming weeks"" if the FDA determines that the vaccine meets ""our own bar and our own guidelines,"" and that another 50 million doses are in various stages of production, the Times reported.

Although many countries are desperate for vaccines, AstraZeneca's shots may not be their first choice, as the vaccine has faced concerns about rare blood clots and its effectiveness against variants, the Post reported.

The European Union (EU) is suing the company for missed delivery targets, and South Africa stopped using the vaccine after a small trial found it was not effective against the dominant variant in the country. The EU also temporarily paused distribution of the vaccine while it investigated the blood clots associated with it, before ultimately resuming injections.

In a statement, a spokesperson for AstraZeneca said the company would not comment on specifics, but that ""the doses are part of AstraZeneca's supply commitments to the U.S. government. Decisions to send U.S. supply to other countries are made by the U.S. government,"" the Times reported.

Millions of Americans have missed their second COVID shot

More than 5 million Americans have missed the second dose of their COVID-19 vaccine, new government data shows.

The number of vaccine recipients who missed their second dose now stands at nearly 8%, more than double the rate seen among people who got inoculated during the first several weeks of the national vaccine campaign, the Times reported.

Already, millions of people are wary about getting vaccinated at all, and now local health authorities are struggling to make sure that those who get their first shot also get their second.

""I'm very worried, because you need that second dose,"" Dr. Paul Offit, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and a member of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's vaccine advisory panel, told the Times.

Why the missed second shots?

Some said they feared the side effects, which can include flu-like symptoms, while others said they felt they were sufficiently protected with a single shot. But a surprising hurdle has also surfaced: A number of vaccine providers have canceled second-dose appointments because they ran out of supply or didn't have the right brand in stock, the Times reported. Walgreens, one of the biggest vaccine providers in the United States, sent some people who got a first shot of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine to get their second doses at pharmacies that only had the other vaccine on hand, the newspaper said. Several Walgreens customers said they scrambled to get the correct second dose, but others likely gave up, the newspaper added.

Public health officials had worried from the start that it would be hard to get everyone to come back for their second shot, and now some state officials are scrambling to keep the tally of partly vaccinated people from swelling.

In Arkansas and Illinois, health officials have directed teams to call, text or send letters to people to remind them to get their second shots. In Pennsylvania, officials are trying to ensure that college students can get their second shots after they leave campus for the summer, the Times reported. South Carolina has allocated several thousand doses specifically for people who are overdue for their second shot.

Compared with the two-dose regimen, a single shot triggers a weaker immune response and may leave some people more susceptible to dangerous virus variants, the Times said. And though a single dose provides some protection against COVID-19, it's not clear how long that protection will last.",www.medicinenet.com
98,U.S. May Ease Outdoor Mask Rules,"Possible easing of mask requirements outdoors are among new recommendations for fully vaccinated people expected to be announced Tuesday by the Biden administration.

Last week, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said the agency was ""looking at"" whether it's still necessary to wear a mask outdoors, and Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease specialist, said Sunday that federal health officials might loosen mask requirements, The New York Times reported.

A vaccinated person's risk of infection outdoors is ""minuscule,"" according to Fauci.

""I think it's pretty common sense now that outdoor risk is really, really quite low,"" for vaccinated people, Fauci said on the ABC News program ""This Week,"" the Times reported.

There's increasing evidence that the risk of coronavirus spread is far lower outdoors than indoors because virus particles disperse quickly outdoors.

Several states have already dropped mask mandates and fully reopened indoor and outdoor venues, even for large sporting events. New York still has mask requirements.

A growing body of research indicates that the risk of spreading the virus is far lower outdoors than indoors. Viral particles disperse quickly outdoors, experts say, meaning brief encounters with a passing walker or jogger pose very little risk of transmission.

""That biker who whizzes by without a mask poses no danger to us, at least from a respiratory virus perspective,"" Dr. Paul Sax, an infectious disease specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, wrote in a blog post for the New England Journal of Medicine, the Times reported.

The CDC currently recommends that vaccinated people wear masks and maintain 6 feet of distance from others in public, including while taking public transportation such as buses, trains or planes and while in transportation hubs. It also recommends they continue to avoid crowds, large gatherings and poorly ventilated spaces, the Times said.

131,Pediatric Obstructive Sleep Apnea,"Overview

Pediatric obstructive sleep apnea is a sleep disorder in which your child's breathing is partially or completely blocked repeatedly during sleep. The condition is due to narrowing or blockage of the upper airway during sleep.

There are differences between pediatric obstructive sleep apnea and adult sleep apnea. While adults usually have daytime sleepiness, children are more likely to have behavioral problems. The underlying cause in adults is often obesity, while in children the most common underlying condition is enlargement of the adenoids and tonsils.

Early diagnosis and treatment are important to prevent complications that can affect children's growth, cognitive development and behavior.

Symptoms

During sleep, signs and symptoms of pediatric sleep apnea might include:

Snoring

Pauses in breathing

Restless sleep

Snorting, coughing or choking

Mouth breathing

Nighttime sweating

Bed-wetting

Sleep terrors

Infants and young children with obstructive sleep apnea don't always snore. They might just have disturbed sleep.

During the day, children with sleep apnea might:

Perform poorly in school

Have difficulty paying attention

Have learning problems

Have behavioral problems

Have poor weight gain

Be hyperactive

When to see a doctor

Make an appointment with your child's doctor if your child consistently wakes up in the morning feeling tired and has behavioral problems.

Causes

Obesity is a common factor underlying obstructive sleep apnea in adults. But in children the most common condition leading to obstructive sleep apnea is enlarged tonsils and adenoids. However, obesity also plays a role in children. Other underlying factors can be craniofacial anomalies and neuromuscular disorders.

Risk factors

Besides obesity, other risk factors for pediatric sleep apnea include having:

Down syndrome

Abnormalities in the skull or face

Cerebral palsy

Sickle cell disease

Neuromuscular disease

History of low birth weight

Family history of obstructive sleep apnea

Complications

Pediatric obstructive sleep apnea can have serious complications, including:",www.mayoclinic.org
132,Healthy Food Choices for Your Family,"Page Content

​How can you ensure that your child is well nourished?

Here are some tips to keep in mind when planning and preparing meals for your family.

Variety

Your child should consume a variety of foods from the five major food groups. Each food group supplies important nutrients, including vitamins and minerals.



The five food groups and typical minimum servings:

Vegetables: 3-5 servings per day. A serving may consist of 1 cup of raw leafy vegetables, 3/4 cup of vegetable juice, or 1/2 cup of other vegetables, chopped raw or cooked.

Fruits: 2-4 servings per day. A serving may consist of 1/2 cup of sliced fruit, 3/4 cup of fruit juice, or a medium-size whole fruit, like an apple, banana, or pear.

Bread, cereal, or pasta: 6-11 servings per day. Each serving should equal 1 slice of bread, 1/2 cup of rice or pasta, or 1 ounce of cereal.

Protein foods: 2-3 servings of 2-3 ounces of cooked lean meat, poultry, or fish per day. A serving in this group may also consist of 1/2 cup of cooked dry beans, one egg, or 2 tablespoons of peanut butter for each ounce of lean meat.

Dairy products: 2-3 servings per day of 1 cup of low-fat milk or yogurt, or 1 1/2 ounces of natural cheese.

Fiber​

Fiber is a carbohydrate component of plant foods that is usually un-digestible. It is found in foods like fruits, vegetables, whole-grain breads, cereals, brown rice, beans, seeds, and nuts.

In adults: Increased fiber has been linked with a reduction of chronic gastrointestinal problems, including colon cancer, irritable bowel syndrome, and diverticulitis.

In children: Fiber's only proven benefit is its ability to ease constipation—providing bulk that can promote regular bowel movements, soften the stools, and decrease the time it takes food to travel through the intestines. But since food preferences and eating habits often get searly in life, and since high-fiber foods contain other nutrients, parents should include these foods in children's daily diets. See Kids Need Fiber: Here's Why and How.

Protein

Your child needs protein so their body can grow and function properly. This includes building new tissues and producing antibodies that help fight infections. Without essential amino acids (the building blocks of protein), children would be much more susceptible to serious diseases.

Protein-rich plants—such as dried beans and peas (legumes), grains, seeds, and nuts—can be used as valuable sources of protein. Other protein-rich foods include meat, fish, milk, yogurt, cheese, and eggs. These animal products contain high-quality protein and a full array of amino acids.

Keep in mind, however, that while red meat and shellfish are rich in protein and an important source of iron, they can also be high in fat and cholesterol as well. So, your child should consume them only in moderate amounts. Select lean cuts of meat and trim the fat before cooking. Likewise, remove skin from poultry before serving.

Fat

Humans cannot live without fats. They are a concentrated source of energy, providing essential fatty acids that are needed for a variety of bodily processes (metabolism, blood clotting, and vitamin absorption).

However, high fat intake—particularly a diet high in saturated fats—can cause problems. Saturated fats are usually solid at room temperatures and are found in fatty meats (such as beef, pork, ham, veal, and lamb) and many dairy products (whole milk, cheese, and ice cream). They can contribute to the buildup of plague in blood vessels and lead to heart disease later in life. A diet rich in saturated fats also can increase blood cholesterol, particularly in people who have inherited a tendency toward high cholesterol levels.

After age two: Children should be served foods that are lower in fat and saturated fats. Chances are that your child's favorite foods are higher in fat than is desirable. Healthy ating means relying more on low-fat, low-cholesterol foods like poultry, fish, and lean meat (broiled, baked, or roasted; not fried), soft margarine (instead of butter), low-fat dairy products, and low-saturated-fat oils from vegetables, while limiting egg consumption.

As a general guideline, fats should make up less than 30% of the calories in your child's diet. No more than about 1/3 or less of those fat calories should come from from saturated fat, with the rest coming from unsaturated (that is, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated) fats. These healthier fats are liquid at room temperature and include vegetable oils like corn, safflower, sunflower, soybean, and olive.

Some parents find the information about various types of fat confusing. In general, oils and fats that come from animals are saturated. The simplest place to start is just to reduce the amount of fatty foods of all types in your family's diet. See How to Reduce Fat and Cholesterol in Your Child's Diet.

Sugar

Limit the amount of sugar in your child's diet to to moderate levels. Sugar has plenty of calories, but dietitians often call them “empty calories"" because they have very little additional nutritional value. Even so, many children consume sugar in large amounts, usually at the expense of healthier foods. When children drink sodas, for example, they are usually leaving the milk in the refrigerator; when they eat a brownie, they may be overlooking the bowl of fruit, a good source of complex carbohydrates, on the kitchen table.

Salt

Table salt, or sodium chloride, may improve the taste of certain foods. However, researchers have found a relationship between salt in the diet and high blood pressure in some people.

High blood pres­sure afflicts about 25% of adult Americans ​​and contributes to heart attacks and strokes.

The habit of using extra salt is an learned one. So, as much as possible, serve your child foods low in salt. In the kitchen, minimize the amount of salt you add to food as you prepare it. Try using herbs, spices, or lemon juice instead. Take the salt shaker off the dinner table, or at least limit its use by your family.

Because salt acts a preservative, processed foods often contain large amounts of it. Salt-rich foods may include processed cheese, instant puddings, canned vegetables, canned soups, hot dogs, cottage cheese, salad dressings, pickles, and potato chips and other snacks.

133,Keep it Going! How to Stick with a Fitness Routine,"Sticking to a fitness routine isn't always easy with family, work, hobbies, and everything in between. These tips can help you get started and keep you moving, even when life gets busy.

Find an activity you like. Whether it's walking, biking, or playing a recreational sport, the key to maintaining your exercise routine is doing something you find interesting and enjoyable.

A workout buddy can help keep you accountable and make exercise more fun.

Schedule a time for it. You are more likely to stick with an exercise routine if it is part of your day. Find a time that's most convenient for you, whether it's first thing in the morning or after work. If you don't have 30 full minutes to dedicate to exercise, try to be active a few times throughout the day.

Get active with friends. A workout buddy can help keep you accountable and make exercise more fun. During social distancing you can do this by working out with someone in your household or with a friend or family member digitally.

Measure your progress. Keep track of how far you walked, how much weight you lifted, or how far you stretched. Measuring your progress and noting improvements will help you stay motivated.

Try something new! Exercise shouldn't be boring. Trying a new exercise video or sport is one way to keep your exercise routine fresh.",magazine.medlineplus.gov
134,How to Cope with the Stress of Social Isolation,"Social isolation, or being physically separated from others, can lead to loneliness and increased stress, especially during a pandemic.

Loneliness has been associated with higher rates of depression, anxiety, and suicide. It can also weaken our immune systems, which helps protect us from getting sick. Luckily, understanding stress and loneliness and how to manage them can help.

How stress affects us

While some stress is normal, too much of it can interfere with daily activities, relationships, and work. Symptoms of stress and anxiety include:

Feeling irritable, restless, and on edge

Feeling overwhelmed and unmotivated

Muscle tension

Fatigue or tiredness

Difficulty concentrating

Combating stress

To combat stress, make sure to eat a diet full of heart-healthy fruits, vegetables, and grains. Get enough sleep (for adults, that is usually between 7 and 8 hours) and seek out physical activity.

Connecting with nature can lower levels of stress and reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression. A walk or bike ride may make you feel better and stay physically fit. Just 30 minutes of physical activity a day can make a big difference. Remember to wear a mask even when you are outside. Also, keep 6 feet of space between yourself and people who do not live in your home.

Combating loneliness

Avoiding in-person social gatherings will help keep you and others safe. But you can stay in touch with people in other ways:

Connect with loved ones through online games, video calls, or messaging apps.

Look online for virtual exercise classes, religious services, and cultural events.

Try at-home, guided yoga, mindfulness, or meditation through a mobile app.

Consider adopting a pet. Pets can provide comfort and lower blood pressure, according to the National Institute on Aging.

Reach out to a health care professional

Stress and social isolation can worsen existing mental illness. Consult your health care provider if your feelings are getting in the way of your daily life.

""For those with mental illnesses, be sure to continue your treatment regimens,"" says Joshua Gordon, M.D., Ph.D., director of the National Institute of Mental Health. ""Consider developing a plan for telehealth sessions with your provider if you (or your provider) are quarantined or must avoid exposures to the public for any reason. And reach out to friends and family for support, virtually if necessary.""",magazine.medlineplus.gov
135,New Research on Palliative Care and COVID-19,"Jean Kutner, M.D., a professor of medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, is a well-known expert in palliative and hospice care. She is also a top researcher in the field. She says palliative care ""focuses on the whole person, addressing their spiritual, psychological, and medical needs along the whole course of their journey with a serious illness.""

This year, the COVID-19 pandemic has spotlighted the need for doctors and nurses trained in palliative care. Hospitals are treating thousands of seriously ill patients. Many of them may end up on life support with their families unable to be with them.

Dr. Kutner discussed how palliative care teams are helping patients and families during this time.

Doctors and nurses trained in palliative care have been in high demand during the pandemic. Has the crisis shown people how this kind of care can help patients and their families?

Yes, absolutely. At hospitals across the country, there has been increased demand for palliative care teams. They help overwhelmed families, patients, and hospital staff cope with this very serious illness. It has been especially hard for patients and families who have to be separated because the virus is so contagious. A palliative care team can support families that have to make difficult decisions. The pandemic has also shown the importance of having conversations about the goals of care—such as, do you want to be on a ventilator?—and documenting someone who can make medical decisions for a patient who is seriously ill or dying. This is also known as a health care proxy.

""A palliative care team can support families that have to make difficult decisions."" – Jean Kutner, M.D.

Much of the early research on the benefits of palliative care involved cancer patients. How is the scope of palliative care expanding?

It's true that palliative care had its roots in helping people with cancer. In the last five-plus years, there has been more work with people who have Parkinson's, ALS, heart failure, lung diseases like COPD, advanced kidney disease, and dementia. These groups have different needs than cancer patients. There's also been exciting research supporting children and adolescents with progressive, life-limiting illness.

Can you tell us about the NIH-funded research you are involved in?

I am the lead researcher in a large national project funded by the National Institute of Nursing Research on providing training for other palliative care researchers. I'm also doing research on training palliative care providers to help families with the most difficult conversations regarding a family member's health.

Until recently, people may not have heard of palliative care or confused it with hospice care. Is that changing?

When I gave talks to public groups about palliative care 10 years ago, I often would get blank stares. But that is changing. More people have heard of it. There is also a growing number of patient and provider groups who are huge advocates of it. I especially see that among our nursing and medical school students, even clinical psychology students. When I do interviews for residency programs in internal medicine, the students ask about rotations in palliative care. They feel it's important. This generation of trainees is truly going to change this field.",magazine.medlineplus.gov
136,Comfort Care for Kids and Their Families: A Mother's Story,"When Jake Swoyer was born in 1995, he seemed like any other healthy baby boy. His family—parents, John and Barbara Swoyer, and big brother Ryan, then 3— were thrilled.

But when Jake, who is from Sudbury, Massachusetts, was 7 months old, he had his first seizure. After that, ""he got very sick, very quickly,"" his mother says. His seizures came frequently and could last up to an hour. ""We had 23 ambulance rides in that first year.""

""I had no idea what palliative care really was or what it could do for us."" – Barbara Swoyer

Despite a lot of testing, doctors were unable to determine a cause for his seizures until Jake was nearly 10 years old, when a test revealed he had a genetic mutation associated with Dravet syndrome. Dravet syndrome is a lifelong, rare form of epilepsy that begins in the first year of life and typically doesn't respond to medication. Jake was also later diagnosed with mitochondrial dysfunction, adding to the severity and complexity of his disease.

Since he was diagnosed, Jake has suffered a long, slow, steady decline in his health, his mother says. Palliative care has made all the difference in how the family has coped with Jake's devastating condition and in helping Jake enjoy a good quality of life. He received pediatric palliative care support and services until he turned 21.

Finding palliative care

""When Jake was first diagnosed, our physician suggested enrolling him in palliative care. Like many families, my first thought was, 'Oh no, he thinks my son is dying.' I had no idea what palliative care really was or what it could do for us,"" Barbara recalls.

She finally took his suggestion after about a year. As Barbara worked with several different providers, ""a light bulb finally went off. I realized what palliative care was supposed to be,"" she says. ""Along with providing clinical and emotional support, the palliative team introduced comfort care measures. Jake was able to receive pet therapy for enjoyment, massage therapy for relaxation, and music therapy for active engagement and socialization. Each of these therapies brought joy and positive change into his daily life.""

Palliative care services also included a medical team to help with medical support and crisis management, Barbara says. ""They could come to the house, diagnose a problem, and prescribe and provide treatment. We didn't have to go to the hospital for every problem."" Having home-based medical support allowed the family to treat problems in their own home, which became especially important as Jake got older.

Embracing a difficult but important path

A chaplain and a social worker paid regular visits to the Swoyer home.

""In 25 years of caring for a child with limited life expectancy, these were two of the more meaningful and pivotal people I had the opportunity to work with,"" Barbara says. They were open to and encouraged philosophical discussion about Jake's eventual end of life.

""They helped us consider and define our goals of care,"" Barbara says. ""From these conversations, we felt at peace with past decisions and better equipped to make future decisions on Jake's behalf. It was a relief to have these discussions in periods of calm, rather than in moments of crisis.""

Barbara is a founding member of the Parent Advisory Board for Courageous Parents Network, a nonprofit organization that helps families and providers caring for children with serious illness. Her wish is for families to understand that palliative care is about helping a child live well in the face of life-threatening disease.

""It's about bringing happiness and comfort to a child, while also supporting the entire family unit, no matter where they are on their journey with serious illness,"" she says.

137,Why Does Your Back Hurt?,"Gwendolyn Sowa, M.D., Ph.D.

Identifying the cause of low back pain has become a frequent challenge for medical professionals. It is also what has encouraged Gwendolyn Sowa, M.D., Ph.D., of the University of Pittsburgh to study the topic.

Low back pain is a widespread issue in the U.S. It affects more than 25% of workers, according to a recent national health survey. An injury, working in a physically demanding job, or working in a job where you sit too much can all contribute to back pain.

""It's one of the most common causes of disability both from a quality of life perspective but also from a productivity perspective,"" Dr. Sowa says. ""It has a huge impact on how patients can function in their everyday life, whether that's their work, their home-related activities, or their leisure activities.""

Because of how widespread it is, low back pain also presents an opportunity for researchers.

""The findings on traditional imaging such as X-rays and MRIs often have a very poor correlation with patient symptoms."" – Gwendolyn Sowa, M.D., Ph.D.

An opportunity for change

""It's also one of the areas that we have the biggest opportunity to change the way we care for patients,"" Dr. Sowa explained. One of those opportunities is around identifying contributors to back pain.

""The findings on traditional imaging such as X-rays and MRIs often have a very poor correlation with patient symptoms,"" Dr. Sowa explains. She says that many people who might have physical damage to their low back may not experience any symptoms. On the other hand, some individuals might experience a great deal of low back pain but could have little visible damage.

Through her work supported by the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, Dr. Sowa and her collaborators study better ways to treat people based on their individual symptoms and medical history. This includes looking at factors like genetics, stress, lifestyle, behaviors, and activity levels.

Holistic health for low back pain

Rather than treating one symptom or only looking at one aspect of a person's pain, Dr. Sowa says she and her team aim for a more well-rounded approach.

""We want to develop precision medicine approaches to their treatment that we hope will be more effective and prevent a trial-and-error type of approach to treating these patients,"" Dr. Sowa says.

She adds that the ultimate goal of her research is to decrease unnecessary treatments and increase the chances of finding the right treatment the first time.

""If we don't improve [patients'] function and get their pain under control, they're more likely to progress to chronic back pain,"" she says.

Addressing chronic pain

Dr. Sowa also studies how to better address chronic back pain through the Back Pain Consortium (BACPAC) Research Program of the Helping to End Addiction Long-termSM Initiative, or NIH HEAL InitiativeSM. The NIH HEAL Initiative's goal is to help advance research that will address the national opioid public health crisis. Opioids are often prescribed for low back pain. They are strong and sometimes addictive painkillers that have been overused and sometimes misused, and not currently indicated for use in chronic low back pain.

To tackle this complex and common problem, teamwork is key, she notes.

""It's a complex problem, and one that an individual field is not going to solve,"" Dr. Sowa says. ""As we bring physicians and scientists from all different backgrounds together, I'm hoping we can move the needle on it.""",magazine.medlineplus.gov
138,4 Physical Activity Tips for Older Adults,"Regular physical activity is great for your mental and physical health. It also helps you stay independent as you age.

Every day presents opportunities to move more.

The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommend that you aim to exercise at least 150 minutes every week at a moderate pace, or 75 at a more vigorous pace. The guidelines also recommend that older adults do muscle-strengthening activities at least 2 days a week.

Now sure how to get started? These tips can help.

1. Talk with your doctor. Almost anyone, at any age, can exercise safely. If you're concerned about starting an exercise routine, talk with your doctor. Ask whether there are activities you should avoid and whether any health conditions you have might affect what exercises you can do safely.

2. Start gradually. Begin with low-intensity exercises like walking. Be sure to drink plenty of water before, during, and after your workout.

3. Develop a well-rounded routine. Include the four main types of exercise:

Endurance exercises increase your breathing and heart rate. Brisk walking is a good option.

Strength exercises, like lifting weights or using a resistance band, make your muscles stronger.

Balance exercises can help prevent falls. This includes standing on one foot.

Flexibility exercises, like yoga, stretch your muscles and help you stay limber and maintain mobility as you age.

141,Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR TB),"Fact Sheet

(PDFpdf icon – 37k)

Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR TB)

What is tuberculosis (TB)?

Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease caused by bacteria that are spread from person to person through the air. TB usually affects the lungs, but it can also affect other parts of the body, such as the brain, the kidneys, or the spine. In most cases, TB is treatable and curable; however, persons with TB can die if they do not get proper treatment.

What is multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB)?

Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR TB) is caused by an organism that is resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampin, the two most potent TB drugs. These drugs are used to treat all persons with TB disease.

What is extensively drug resistant tuberculosis (XDR TB)?

Extensively drug resistant TB (XDR TB) is a rare type of MDR TB that is resistant to isoniazid and rifampin, plus any fluoroquinolone and at least one of three injectable second-line drugs (i.e., amikacin, kanamycin, or capreomycin).

Because XDR TB is resistant to the most potent TB drugs, patients are left with treatment options that are much less effective.

XDR TB is of special concern for persons with HIV infection or other conditions that can weaken the immune system. These persons are more likely to develop TB disease once they are infected, and also have a higher risk of death once they develop TB.

How is TB spread?

Drug-susceptible TB and drug-resistant TB are spread the same way. TB bacteria are put into the air when a person with TB disease of the lungs or throat coughs, sneezes, speaks, or sings. These bacteria can float in the air for several hours, depending on the environment. Persons who breathe in the air containing these TB bacteria can become infected.

TB is not spread by

Shaking someone’s hand

Sharing food or drink

Touching bed linens or toilet seats

Sharing toothbrushes

Kissing

How does drug resistance happen?

Resistance to anti-TB drugs can occur when these drugs are misused or mismanaged. Examples include when patients do not complete their full course of treatment; when health-care providers prescribe the wrong treatment, the wrong dose, or length of time for taking the drugs; when the supply of drugs is not always available; or when the drugs are of poor quality.

Who is at risk for getting MDR TB?

Drug resistance is more common in people who:

Do not take their TB medicine regularly

Do not take all of their TB medicine as told by their doctor or nurse

Develop TB disease again, after having taken TB medicine in the past

Come from areas of the world where drug-resistant TB is common

Have spent time with someone known to have drug-resistant TB disease

How can MDR TB be prevented?

The most important thing a person can do to prevent the spread of MDR TB is to take all of their medications exactly as prescribed by their health care provider. No doses should be missed and treatment should not be stopped early. Patients should tell their health care provider if they are having trouble taking the medications. If patients plan to travel, they should talk to their health care providers and make sure they have enough medicine to last while away.

Health care providers can help prevent MDR TB by quickly diagnosing cases, following recommended treatment guidelines, monitoring patients’ response to treatment, and making sure therapy is completed.

Another way to prevent getting MDR TB is to avoid exposure to known MDR TB patients in closed or crowded places such as hospitals, prisons, or homeless shelters. If you work in hospitals or health-care settings where TB patients are likely to be seen, you should consult infection control or occupational health experts. Ask about administrative and environmental procedures for preventing exposure to TB. Once those procedures are implemented, additional measures could include using personal respiratory protective devices.

Is there a vaccine to prevent TB?

Yes, there is a vaccine for TB disease called Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG). It is used in some countries to prevent severe forms of TB in children. However, BCG is not generally recommended in the United States because it has limited effectiveness for preventing TB overall.

What should I do if I think I have been exposed to someone with TB disease?

If you think you have been exposed to someone with TB disease, you should contact your doctor or local health department about getting a TB skin test or TB blood test. And tell the doctor or nurse when you spent time with this person.

What are the symptoms of TB disease?

The general symptoms of TB disease include feelings of sickness or weakness, weight loss, fever, and night sweats. The symptoms of TB disease of the lungs may also include coughing, chest pain, and coughing up blood. Symptoms of TB disease in other parts of the body depend on the area affected. If you have these symptoms, you should contact your doctor or local health department.

142,Good Sleep for Good Health: Get the Rest You Need,"Good Sleep for Good Health

Get the Rest You Need

Sometimes, the pace of modern life barely gives you time to stop and rest. It can make getting a good night’s sleep on a regular basis seem like a dream.

But sleep is as important for good health as diet and exercise. Good sleep improves your brain performance, mood, and health.

Not getting enough quality sleep regularly raises the risk of many diseases and disorders. These range from heart disease and stroke to obesity and dementia.

There’s more to good sleep than just the hours spent in bed, says Dr. Marishka Brown, a sleep expert at NIH. “Healthy sleep encompasses three major things,” she explains. “One is how much sleep you get. Another is sleep quality—that you get uninterrupted and refreshing sleep. The last is a consistent sleep schedule.”

People who work the night shift or irregular schedules may find getting quality sleep extra challenging. And times of great stress—like the current pandemic—can disrupt our normal sleep routines. But there are many things you can do to improve your sleep.

Sleep for Repair

Why do we need to sleep? People often think that sleep is just “down time,” when a tired brain gets to rest, says Dr. Maiken Nedergaard, who studies sleep at the University of Rochester.

“But that’s wrong,” she says. While you sleep, your brain is working. For example, sleep helps prepare your brain to learn, remember, and create.

Nedergaard and her colleagues discovered that the brain has a drainage system that removes toxins during sleep.

“When we sleep, the brain totally changes function,” she explains. “It becomes almost like a kidney, removing waste from the system.”

Her team found in mice that the drainage system removes some of the proteins linked with Alzheimer’s disease. These toxins were removed twice as fast from the brain during sleep.

Everything from blood vessels to the immune systemThe system that protects your body from invading viruses, bacteria, and other microscopic threats. uses sleep as a time for repair, says Dr. Kenneth Wright, Jr., a sleep researcher at the University of Colorado.

“There are certain repair processes that occur in the body mostly, or most effectively, during sleep,” he explains. “If you don’t get enough sleep, those processes are going to be disturbed.”

Sleep Myths and Truths

How much sleep you need changes with age. Experts recommend school-age children get at least nine hours a night and teens get between eight and 10. Most adults need at least seven hours or more of sleep each night.

There are many misunderstandings about sleep. One is that adults need less sleep as they get older. This isn’t true. Older adults still need the same amount. But sleep quality can get worse as you age. Older adults are also more likely to take medications that interfere with sleep.

Another sleep myth is that you can “catch up” on your days off. Researchers are finding that this largely isn’t the case.

“If you have one bad night’s sleep and take a nap, or sleep longer the next night, that can benefit you,” says Wright. “But if you have a week’s worth of getting too little sleep, the weekend isn’t sufficient for you to catch up. That’s not a healthy behavior.”

In a recent study, Wright and his team looked at people with consistently deficient sleep. They compared them to sleep-deprived people who got to sleep in on the weekend.

Both groups of people gained weight with lack of sleep. Their bodies’ ability to control blood sugar levels also got worse. The weekend catch-up sleep didn’t help.

On the flip side, more sleep isn’t always better, says Brown. For adults, “if you’re sleeping more than nine hours a night and you still don’t feel refreshed, there may be some underlying medical issue,” she explains.

Sleep Disorders

Some people have conditions that prevent them from getting enough quality sleep, no matter how hard they try. These problems are called sleep disorders.

The most common sleep disorder is insomnia. “Insomnia is when you have repeated difficulty getting to sleep and/or staying asleep,” says Brown. This happens despite having the time to sleep and a proper sleep environment. It can make you feel tired or unrested during the day.

Insomnia can be short-term, where people struggle to sleep for a few weeks or months. “Quite a few more people have been experiencing this during the pandemic,” Brown says. Long-term insomnia lasts for three months or longer.

Sleep apnea is another common sleep disorder. In sleep apnea, the upper airway becomes blocked during sleep. This reduces or stops airflow, which wakes people up during the night. The condition can be dangerous. If untreated, it may lead to other health problems.

If you regularly have problems sleeping, talk with your health care provider. They may have you keep a sleep diary to track your sleep for several weeks. They can also run tests, including sleep studies. These look for sleep disorders.

Getting Better Sleep

If you’re having trouble sleeping, hearing how important it is may be frustrating. But simple things can improve your odds of a good night’s sleep. See the Wise Choices box for tips to sleep better every day.

Treatments are available for many common sleep disorders. Cognitive behavioral therapy can help many people with insomnia get better sleep. Medications can also help some people.

Many people with sleep apnea benefit from using a device called a CPAP machine. These machines keep the airway open so that you can breathe. Other treatments can include special mouthguards and lifestyle changes.

For everyone, “as best you can, try to make sleep a priority,” Brown says. “Sleep is not a throwaway thing—it’s a biological necessity.”",newsinhealth.nih.gov
143,Pregnancy Check-Ups: Healthy Start for Mom and Baby,"Pregnancy Check-Ups

Healthy Start for Mom and Baby

Life is busy before a baby arrives. There are many things to do to prepare. One of the most important is to visit your health care provider regularly.

Check-ups before your baby is born are called prenatal visits. They help make sure you and your baby are healthy. Your health care provider will look for certain problems that can happen during pregnancy. Some issues are best treated early. Others can be prevented before they start.

“Prenatal care is fundamental for shaping the lives of women and their children,” says Dr. Monica Longo, an NIH expert on prenatal health. Longo cares for women with high-risk pregnancies. Such women have a higher chance of complications.

If you think you may be pregnant, schedule a visit with your provider. If you’re pregnant, you’ll need to start regular prenatal visits. Most women have check-ups about once a month in the beginning. Then, they go more often later in the pregnancy.

During a prenatal visit, your provider will ask about your health history. They will also perform a physical exam and weight check. They’ll let you know how much weight gain is healthy for your body and help track your progress.

You’ll also be asked to provide a urine sample. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common during pregnancy. UTIs and other infections increase the risk of having a preterm birth. This is when you give birth at 37 weeks or earlier.

“One of the primary purposes of prenatal care is actually prevention,” says Longo. “We screen women to find potential health problems before those issues can worsen.”

During certain stages of pregnancy, your provider will perform blood tests and imaging tests. These include ultrasound exams to look at the baby’s growth and development. Visits are also an opportunity to talk with your provider about how to give your baby a healthy start.

“During prenatal visits, we educ-ate and counsel moms about healthy habits, healthy food choices, and exercise,” Longo says. “We also address any concerns a new mom-to-be might have.”

Taking a prenatal vitamin is also key. Folic acid is included in most prenatal vitamins. It reduces the risk of severe birth defects that affect the developing brain and spine.

It’s important to stay away from things that could harm your baby. These include certain medications, smoking, and alcoholic drinks. Also, talk with your provider about any health conditions. Conditions like diabetes (a disease that causes high blood sugar) and high blood pressure need to be brought under control.

Some women choose to talk with their provider before becoming pregnant. This is called a preconception visit. It can help you plan for a safer pregnancy.

Early and regular care for you and your developing baby is important. Studies show that prenatal care reduces the risk of having a low-birth weight baby. Low birth weight can cause health problems. Even during the pandemic, it’s essential to keep up with regular prenatal care.

“Providers around the globe have adapted prenatal care to fit the current challenges,” says Longo. That means using telehealth for visits that don’t have to be done in person.

Health care providers are also seeing fewer patients and extending the time between them. This reduces possible exposure in waiting rooms.

“Providers are prepared for these difficult times,” says Longo. So it’s crucial that moms-to-be keep up with prenatal care.",newsinhealth.nih.gov
144,Dr. Kenneth Wright on Shift Work and Sleep,"Q&A

Dr. Kenneth Wright on Shift Work and Sleep

Kenneth P. Wright, Jr., PhD, Professor of Distinction, Director, Sleep and Chronobiology Laboratory, University of Colorado Boulder

Excerpts from our conversation with Dr. Kenneth Wright, Jr., an NIH-funded expert on sleep at the University of Colorado, Boulder.

NIHNiH: What is the circadian system? And why is it disrupted by shift work, such as working the night shift?

Wright: The circadian system is our biological clock. That biological clock controls the timing of a lot of our behaviors. These include when you choose to eat and when you choose to be active. For humans, our bodies are programmed to eat food during the daytime, not at nighttime, and be physically active during the daytime and not at nighttime.

For example, look at a hormone called melatonin. Our clock tells the body when to produce melatonin. And high levels of melatonin signal our biological night. Humans are not meant to be eating when melatonin levels are high.

So when we don’t get enough sleep, we are awake when melatonin levels are high. And if we eat during that time, that is associated with impairments in our blood sugar.

That’s one example, but the same goes for any system in our body. We can show that if you don’t get enough sleep, or if your circadian clock is disturbed, that system will be dysregulated in one way or another.

NIHNiH: What kinds of problems can disrupting your circadian clock cause?

Wright: Long-term disruption of circadian patterns can lead to weight gain, to obesity. It can lead to the development of depression or worsening of it. It can lead to type 2 diabetes, it can lead to heart disease and stroke. It can lead to cancer. And when I say lead to, I mean it’s going to impact a lot of those fundamental processes in the body that contribute to these disorders.

NIHNiH: What advice do you give to people who work the night shift or other shifts that could throw off their biological clocks?

Wright: Shift work is a challenge because it really goes against our fundamental biology. But there are specific tips that we can give to people who do shift work.

One of them is to try to maximize your 24-hour total sleep time. What I mean by that is, say after a night shift a worker goes home, is awake for a little bit, and then goes to sleep. They may sleep for five or six hours. And then they wake up, because the clock in their brain tells them it’s time to be awake, not because they got enough sleep.

So what we what recommend is you get that five or six hours. And then you take about a two-hour nap before you go back to work. That will get you closer to that seven or eight hours of recommended sleep.

There’s also a huge population of shift workers that we tend not to focus on. Those are the early morning shift workers, people who start work before 7 am. They’ve got to go to bed earlier than normal, which can induce insomnia. They can try things like taking melatonin to try to go to bed earlier, or exposure to bright lights to try to shift their clock earlier.

Waking up around the same time every day is also important even for shift workers, because it’s a strong signal for our circadian clock. The more irregular you are, if your wake times are bouncing around every day and on the weekends, that’s associated with a lot of health problems.",newsinhealth.nih.gov
145,Antibodies Protect Against COVID-19 Reinfection,"Health Capsule

Antibodies Protect Against COVID-19 Reinfection

NIAID

After having COVID-19, most people’s bodies develop antibodies to help fight it off. These are special molecules made by the body’s disease defense system, the immune system. A study found that people with these antibodies were less likely to get COVID-19 again.

Researchers looked at more than 3 million people who had an antibody test for SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes COVID-19.

They found that about 11% of people had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. More than 88% had a negative test. And less than 1% of tests were inconclusive.

The scientists looked at who came down with COVID-19 after the test. They analyzed up to 30 days, 31–60 days, 61–90 days, and more than 90 days after.

About 3% to 4% of people with negative antibody tests got COVID-19 in each time period. But those who had antibodies were less likely to have COVID-19 as time went on. Only 0.3% of the people with antibodies had a positive COVID-19 test more than 90 days after. Those without antibodies were 10 times more likely to get the disease.

The findings suggest that people who have a positive result from an antibody test may be at lower risk for future infection with SARS-CoV-2.

NIH’s Dr. Lynn Penberthy, who led the research team, explains that more questions still need to be answered. “We are nevertheless encouraged by this early finding,” she says.",newsinhealth.nih.gov

Dr. Chandra Jackson on COVID-19 and Sleep

Video of Coping with COVID-19: Sleep and Health

Excerpts from a conversation between Dr. Marishka Brown at NIH and Dr. Chandra Jackson, an NIH expert on sleep.

Brown: From a sleep perspective, how is the COVID-19 pandemic affecting people?

Jackson: Before the pandemic, at least a third of Americans were not getting the recommended amount of at least seven hours of sleep per day. And before the coronavirus, millions of people suffered from sleep disorders like insomnia.

It’s likely that the stress many of us had before the pandemic has now increased. For instance, if people already felt isolated and depressed, it could be more difficult now to cope. Some may also feel greater financial strain, or job and housing insecurity.

Many new challenges have also emerged. One is being or knowing an essential worker on the front lines, whether a medical doctor, nurse, or a cashier at a grocery store. This can induce anxiety, which we know negatively affects sleep.

Also, our routines have been disrupted. Keeping track of time can be difficult. Other major challenges relate to not being able to cut off work at the end of the workday because you’re at home. Or trying to manage the house with children who are used to being at school and may be getting too much screen time.

All of these factors many of us have been dealing with can cause stress and strain. Those have been shown to negatively affect sleep. Additionally, simply staying in the house versus going outside can greatly lower your exposure to natural light. And lack of natural light can reduce biological signals that are important for sleep at night.

Brown: How does sleep impact the immune systemThe system that protects your body from invading viruses, bacteria, and other microscopic threats.?

Jackson: Good sleep helps support the immune system. Disrupted sleep can reduce circulating cytokines, which are a type of protein that helps protect against infection. This clearly has implications for being able to ward off infectious agents like coronavirus.

And if you’re actually sick for whatever reason, resting your body seems to help you recover faster. Lastly, chronic sleep deprivation has also been shown to make vaccines less effective, by reducing the body’s ability to respond.

Brown: Can you speak to the role of disparities and sleep, and its interplay with COVID-19?

Jackson: Unfavorable sleep is common in the general population to begin with. But individuals who are Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Native American, and even sexual and gender minorities have been shown to be disproportionately burdened by poor sleep. Social stress is generally believed to be the connection across these different but intersecting social identity groups.

In terms of sleep disorders, the most common are obstructive sleep apnea and insomnia. Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, and Asian populations suffer disproportionately from obstructive sleep apnea. A lot of these disparities appear to start early in life. For instance, Black compared to white children have been shown to have a four to six times higher prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing. This is attributed not to genetics, but to living in economically deprived communities with relevant environmental hazards.

So sleep disparities are clearly relevant to the pandemic. They likely contribute to disparities in conditions like diabetes and heart disease. And these are conditions that we know increase susceptibility to poor outcomes related to COVID-19.

Additionally, the mental stress from COVID that we’re all feeling is likely exacerbating existing sleep disparities, because disadvantaged groups are disproportionately affected by the virus for largely social reasons. For instance, racial/ethnic minority groups are more likely to have service-oriented, essential, frontline, and often risky, low wage jobs without worker protections like paid sick leave.

147,Why You Should Not Use Ivermectin to Treat or Prevent COVID-19,"Image

Español Português 中文 Tagalog Tiếng Việt 한국어

COVID-19. We’ve been living with it for what sometimes seems like forever. Given the number of deaths that have occurred from the disease, it’s perhaps not surprising that some consumers are looking at unconventional treatments, not approved or authorized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Though this is understandable, please beware. The FDA’s job is to carefully evaluate the scientific data on a drug to be sure that it is both safe and effective for a particular use, and then to decide whether or not to approve it. Using any treatment for COVID-19 that’s not approved or authorized by the FDA, unless part of a clinical trial, can cause serious harm.

There seems to be a growing interest in a drug called ivermectin to treat humans with COVID-19. Ivermectin is often used in the U.S. to treat or prevent parasites in animals. The FDA has received multiple reports of patients who have required medical support and been hospitalized after self-medicating with ivermectin intended for horses.

Here’s What You Need to Know about Ivermectin

FDA has not approved ivermectin for use in treating or preventing COVID-19 in humans. Ivermectin tablets are approved at very specific doses for some parasitic worms, and there are topical (on the skin) formulations for head lice and skin conditions like rosacea. Ivermectin is not an anti-viral (a drug for treating viruses).

Taking large doses of this drug is dangerous and can cause serious harm.

If you have a prescription for ivermectin for an FDA-approved use, get it from a legitimate source and take it exactly as prescribed.

Never use medications intended for animals on yourself. Ivermectin preparations for animals are very different from those approved for humans.

What is Ivermectin and How is it Used?

Ivermectin tablets are approved by the FDA to treat people with intestinal strongyloidiasis and onchocerciasis, two conditions caused by parasitic worms. In addition, some topical (on the skin) forms of ivermectin are approved to treat external parasites like head lice and for skin conditions such as rosacea.

Some forms of ivermectin are used in animals to prevent heartworm disease and certain internal and external parasites. It’s important to note that these products are different from the ones for people, and safe when used as prescribed for animals, only.

When Can Taking Ivermectin Be Unsafe?

The FDA has not reviewed data to support use of ivermectin in COVID-19 patients to treat or to prevent COVID-19; however, some initial research is underway. Taking a drug for an unapproved use can be very dangerous. This is true of ivermectin, too.

There’s a lot of misinformation around, and you may have heard that it’s okay to take large doses of ivermectin. That is wrong.

Even the levels of ivermectin for approved uses can interact with other medications, like blood-thinners. You can also overdose on ivermectin, which can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hypotension (low blood pressure), allergic reactions (itching and hives), dizziness, ataxia (problems with balance), seizures, coma and even death.

Ivermectin Products for Animals Are Different from Ivermectin Products for People

For one thing, animal drugs are often highly concentrated because they are used for large animals like horses and cows, which can weigh a lot more than we do—a ton or more. Such high doses can be highly toxic in humans.

Moreover, FDA reviews drugs not just for safety and effectiveness of the active ingredients, but also for the inactive ingredients. Many inactive ingredients found in animal products aren’t evaluated for use in people. Or they are included in much greater quantity than those used in people. In some cases, we don’t know how those inactive ingredients will affect how ivermectin is absorbed in the human body.

Meanwhile, effective ways to limit the spread of COVID-19 continue to be to wear your mask, stay at least 6 feet from others who don’t live with you, wash hands frequently, and avoid crowds.

Telemental health is the use of telecommunications or videoconferencing technology to provide mental health services. It is sometimes referred to as telepsychiatry or telepsychology. Research suggests that telemental health services can be effective for many people, including, but not limited to those with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety.

As the need for providing virtual mental health care services has increased, providers are finding ways to use phone and videoconferencing technology to bring therapy, evaluations, interventions, and medication management to individuals where they are.

Although the practice has become much more common, especially as a result of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, more research is needed to understand when and how telemental health services should be used.

Community Supports for Rural Aging in Place and Independent Living

Older adults (those aged 65 and older) and people with disabilities have unique healthcare needs and often face challenges to meeting these needs. In addition, accessible housing, transportation, employment, educational programs, and specialized healthcare may be limited in many parts of rural America. Community organizations, healthcare facilities, local governments, and other rural entities can help older adults and people with disabilities by collaborating and creatively using limited resources to provide needed services.

This guide includes information about home-based services and community supports available to support aging in place and independent living and discusses challenges for people receiving services and those providing them. For information related to services for veterans with service-related injuries, see Rural Veterans and Access to Healthcare.

Frequently Asked Questions

What types of services and supports can help rural residents to age in place and live independently, and who delivers these services?

Older individuals and people with disabilities may experience physical limitations and need to rely on others for help with activities of daily living. This can be particularly challenging in rural areas. Home and Community-Based Alternatives to Nursing Home Care notes that a wide range of services can help individuals live independently. Types of services that can support aging in place and independent living include, but are not limited to:

Family caregivers, community business and nonprofit organizations, paid home care workers, senior centers, tribal organizations, and volunteers can all provide help to people in rural communities. However, home health services, which are specifically medical in nature, must be provided by skilled medical professionals.

The National Academy for State Health Policy's 2019 Toolkit: State Strategies to Support Older Adults Aging in Place in Rural Areas describes a variety of state initiatives designed to help older rural adults remain in their communities. SASH® (Support and Services at Home) utilizes affordable housing communities throughout Vermont to provide care and services to older adults and individuals with disabilities and promote independent living. The ARcare Aging Well Outreach Network, run by the ARcare Federally Qualified Health Center, provides services including falls prevention assessments, transportation to appointments, medication management, and senior-specific exercise opportunities for Cross County, Arkansas residents over 50 years of age.

For additional examples of home-based services and community supports in rural communities, see the RHIhub's Rural Aging in Place and Access to Care for Rural People with Disabilities Toolkits.

What other services and supports might people with disabilities need in order to live successfully in a rural community?

People with disabilities may use some of the same services and supports as older adults to be able to live independently in rural areas. However, rural residents with disabilities may also benefit from other services and supports. For example, they may experience pain and other secondary conditions that may make it difficult to hold a job. As a result, people with disabilities may need specialized training or rehabilitation services or other assistance to overcome barriers to employment or pursue self-employment. Farm Assessment and Rehabilitation Methods (FARM) Program is one example of a program designed to help disabled farmers continue or resume farming or find an alternative agricultural occupation.

People with disabilities may also need assistance connecting with community services and supports as they transition from a facility back into the community or as they transition into adulthood. Centers for Independent Living (CILs) provide individuals with disabilities with services to help them live independently, including referrals, independent living skills training, and peer counseling. CILs can also offer additional services, including job search support, assistive technology information, and housing option counseling.

People with disabilities and functional limitations also require additional supports in emergency situations. Individuals who are hard of hearing may not hear sirens or other audible alerts, while those with vision impairments may not see flashing lights or other signals. In an emergency, people who use assistive technologies or durable medical equipment may need access to back-up sources of power. Additionally, people with functional disabilities may need accessible transportation options or shelters if evacuation is necessary. For information on preparing and responding to emergencies in rural communities, see RHIhub's Rural Emergency Preparedness and Response topic guide.

Why is it important for people living in rural areas to have access to home-based services and community supports?

Older adults and people with disabilities living in rural areas, like their urban counterparts, typically prefer to live in their own homes, rather than in assisted living facilities or nursing homes. While they may be able to thrive in the community, older adults and individuals with disabilities may also need some assistance in carrying out key everyday activities such as bathing or cooking. Similarly, Differences in Social Isolation and Its Relationship to Health by Rurality highlights that while older adults in rural areas report larger social networks than their urban counterparts, they experience increased risks of social isolation and loneliness. Social isolation among older adults has been linked to poor health outcomes and increased healthcare spending. As a result, rural areas may need to provide additional services and supports to keep older adults and people with disabilities included and active in community life. Older adults and people with disabilities may also face additional challenges in rural areas related to:

Transportation to medical appointments, grocery shopping, and other essential and leisure activities

Housing quality and affordability, including how to pay for needed repairs, modifications, and assistive technologies that would allow them to continue to live safely in the home

Availability of home-based services and community supports in their communities that will allow them to live independently at home.

Paid caregiver workforce shortages.

Support for informal caregivers to prevent feelings of isolation and burnout.

Meeting the Social Needs of Older Adults in Rural Areas demonstrates how home-based services and community supports can foster social connections as well as connect residents with needs and services that promote health and wellness.

What are livable communities, and how do they facilitate aging in place and independent living in rural communities?

Livable communities meet the full range of needs of all its residents. Partners for Livable Communities defines livability as “the sum of the factors that add up to a community's quality of life—including the built and natural environments, economic prosperity, social stability and equity, educational opportunity, and cultural, entertainment and recreation possibilities.” AARP also notes that a livable community will “enhance personal independence; allow residents to remain in their homes and communities; and foster residents' engagement in the community's civic, economic, and social life.” As a result, the exact characteristics of livability will be unique to each community.

The terms “aging in place” and “independent living” describe different aspects of livable communities. People who want to age in place are those who want to remain in a place of their choice, typically one in which they have invested time and money, where they have an informal support network and which holds fond memories for them. There are typically fewer housing options available in rural communities, making it difficult to downsize or find accessible housing. Also, home repairs or modifications may be necessary for an individual to remain in their community. Similarly, nutrition services may be necessary for adults who cannot safely cook for themselves. For more information on aging in place in rural communities, see the RHIhub's Rural Aging in Place Toolkit.

The term independent living can simply refer to an arrangement in which people with disabilities live in a community rather than in an institutional setting. Interpreted more broadly, it is a philosophy which promotes the idea that people with disabilities have the same civil rights as people without disabilities, and should make their own decisions about how they will live, work, and participate in society in the least restrictive environment. This approach focuses on ensuring that communities meet the needs of all people who live there.

Universal design principles should be considered when designing rural infrastructure. Universal design goes beyond meeting accessibility standards and seeks to address usability concerns for people of all ages and abilities throughout the entire design of a building or community. Curb cuts are one example of universal design. Originally designed to improve access for individuals with mobility and visual impairments, curb cuts also assist cyclists, families with strollers, and travelers with luggage, among many others.

By embracing the concepts of aging in place, independent living, and universal design, communities can help individuals remain and thrive in their homes or community setting of their choice, no matter their age or ability. For information on evidence-based and promising models and resources to support organizations and communities in creating rural livable communities, see the RHIhub's Rural Aging in Place and Access to Care for Rural People with Disabilities Toolkits.

What resources are available to find services for older adults and individuals with disabilities who wish to remain in their homes?

The National Institute on Aging's webpage Aging in Place: Growing Old at Home offers suggestions for planning ahead to stay at home, lists the kinds of supports that may be needed, and offers contact information for various agencies and programs that can provide help and guidance. It notes that resources can include:

Friends, family, and neighbors

Community businesses and nonprofit organizations

Geriatric care managers

Senior centers

Area Agencies on Aging

Tribal organizations

Federal, state, and local government resources

The World Health Organization defines age-friendly environments as ones that:

“foster health and well-being and the participation of people as they age. They are accessible, equitable, inclusive, safe and secure, and supportive. They promote health and prevent or delay the onset of disease and functional decline. They provide people-centered services and support to enable recovery or to compensate for the loss of function so that people can continue to do the things that are important to them.”

Centers for Independent Living are community-based, consumer-controlled nonprofit organizations funded by the Administration for Community Living (ACL) to provide individuals with disabilities a range of services to promote independent living. While CILs can offer more services, they are required to provide information and referral services, independent living skills training, peer counseling, and services that facilitate transition from nursing homes and other institutions to the community. ACL maintains a state-by-state list of Centers for Independent Living.

The Grantmakers in Aging publication Guiding Principles for the Sustainability of Age-Friendly Community Efforts notes that “Champions for age-friendly communities can be found in neighborhoods, elected offices, non-profit organizations, universities, and businesses.” Churches and local nonprofit organizations may be helpful in providing services or referrals. Age-Friendly and Dementia-Friendly Winnemucca and Humboldt County describes how the rural community of Winnemucca, Nevada, worked to create an age-friendly and dementia-friendly community that expanded to Humboldt County.

The National PACE (Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly) Association supports and promotes programs that provide comprehensive medical care and community-based services to help older people live as independently as possible for as long as possible. RHIhub's Rural Services Integration Toolkit highlights the work of Senior CommUnity Care (Delta and Montrose Counties, Colorado), an example of a rural PACE program. For a list of currently operating PACE centers, search Find a PACE Program in Your Neighborhood.

The Eldercare Locator, 1.800.677.1116, provides access to state and local Area Agencies on Aging, as well as community-based organizations and services addressing a range of concerns, including housing, transportation, elder abuse prevention, and more. Churches and civic groups may also be able to make referrals to local sources for services.

What are the workforce and training challenges related to providing home-based services and community supports?

State Solutions to the Home Care Workforce Crisis in Rural America notes that many workers providing home-based services in rural areas work only part-time, earning less on average than workers in urban areas. According to the report Preventing Caregiver Turnover, low wages are a major factor in the high turnover rate among home care workers. This results in a heavier workload for employees who do remain, and creates losses in productivity, morale problems, and a lack of care management. In addition, National Survey of Area Agencies on Aging 2020 Report: Meeting the Needs of Today's Older Adults reports that workforce challenges have resulted in 62% of AAAs delaying the start of services for individuals, 59% increasing the size of staff caseloads, and 49% starting or extending waitlists for services.

As more medical care for people with multiple chronic conditions takes place in the home, the care provided in the home becomes more complex and requires additional skills. As described in the Government Accountability Office report Medicaid Home- and Community-Based Services: Selected States' Program Structures and Challenges Providing Services, recipients of home- and community-based services may have complex medical and behavioral needs and may display aggressive behaviors. In response, some organizations may offer specialized behavioral health training to help workers deal with these situations appropriately.

What does a lack of home-based services and community supports in a community mean for older adults, people with disabilities, and their families?

Caregiving in the U.S. 2020, a report from AARP and the National Alliance for Caregiving, offers a national profile of unpaid family caregivers for rural adults. Notably, family caregivers of older adults living in rural areas often do not live in a rural area themselves and continue to work while serving as a primary caregiver. The report also highlights that caregivers are likely to find it difficult to find available, affordable services in rural communities.

The report Transportation, Distance, and Health Care Utilization for Older Adults in Rural and Small Urban Areas notes that people who do not have access to reliable transportation are more likely to delay getting needed healthcare or forego it entirely. This can result in a need for emergency care or a hospitalization that could otherwise have been avoided. For more information on the consequences of a lack of transportation for rural residents who have disabilities or are older, see the RHIhub Transportation to Support Rural Healthcare topic guide.

Rural people who are unable to find necessary supports in their community may have little choice but to relocate to a nursing home. According to the policy brief Are Rural Older Adults Benefiting from Increased State Spending on Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services?, rural Medicaid beneficiaries were more likely to use skilled nursing facilities than urban Medicaid beneficiaries. Similarly, Rural Long-Term Services and Supports: A Primer describes how rural residential care facilities, such as assisted living facilities, serve populations with more diverse needs than facilities in urban areas. This may reflect that there are few long-term care options in rural areas, in addition to the possible lack of other support services in the community.

How can home-based services and community supports help informal caregivers?

The August 2019 publication Supportive Services and Caregiving for Rural Adults: Policy Brief and Recommendations to the Secretary from the National Advisory Committee on Rural Health and Human Services (NACRHHS) notes that nearly 44 million family and friends serve as informal, unpaid caregivers to older adults and individuals with disabilities each year. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one in four rural adults provide care or assistance to a friend or family member with a health concern or disability. Over half of these caregivers provide care for over two years, and 30% spend at least 20 hours per week providing care. As a result, informal caregivers can incur psychological, physical, and financial stress when caring for another individual.

Home-based services and community supports can benefit friend and family caregivers as well as patients. For example, reliable, accessible transportation services can allow caregivers to maintain regular work hours with the peace of mind that their loved ones can visit grocery stores, attend community centers, or travel to medical appointments. The Missouri Rural Health Association's HealthTran program coordinates non-emergency medical transportation for individuals who need routine and preventative medical care. Similarly, adult day centers provide supervised care to dependent adults, relieving caregivers from attending to their family members continuously throughout the day.

The policy brief Perspectives on Rural Caregiving Challenges and Interventions examines strategies for supporting informal caregivers. Key informants noted that increased financial support, development of a national strategy, and expanded access to resources would all be beneficial for informal caregivers. On a local level, the following strategies are helpful:

Increase awareness of caregivers' needs through workplace programs and churches

Provide infrastructure to enable rural families to more easily access technology services

Offer training to caregivers, so that they will feel more prepared and confident in their ability to help loved ones

Improve Medicaid services

Expand family leave policies and economic incentives for caregivers

Offer screening for caregiver depression and isolation

The 2019 Milbank Memorial Fund report In Support of Family Caregivers: A Snapshot of Five States notes that as demographics change and the country has a larger percentage of older Americans, there will be a need for public policies to support family and unpaid caregivers. For example, the Maine housing administration provides up to $3,800 in tax credits for home modifications for older adults, and Minnesota used grant funding from its Live Well at Home program to partner with Chicago REST (Respite Education Support Tools) to increase the availability of respite care for caregivers.

Resources for Caregiving in Rural Communities gives descriptions and contact information for several national and state-level programs that provide services.

For more information on the challenges and opportunities informal caregivers experience in adopting technology to aid their caregiving efforts, read the Rural Monitor article Informal Caregiving and Technology in Rural America.

What is the Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services Waiver Program?

In the past, long-term support services funded by Medicaid have typically been delivered in nursing facilities or other institutions. However, Medicaid's home and community-based services waivers (HCBS or 1915(c) Waivers) allow states to develop programs to meet needs of Medicaid beneficiaries who want to remain in their own homes or communities. States can apply for multiple waivers to tailor programs and services to specific groups identified by age or diagnosis. Waiver programs must:

Show that the services provided under the waiver will not cost more than the same services provided in an institution.

Ensure that people's health and welfare will be protected

Establish standards for providers to meet the needs of the participants

Develop and follow a plan of care that is individualized and person-centered

Key State Policy Choices About Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services highlights the variation in how these services are provided at the state level. However, Are Rural Older Adults Benefiting from Increased State Spending on Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services?, a 2016 report from the Maine Rural Health Research Center, examines how urban and rural older adults utilize these services differently.

For more information, see Medicaid's Home & Community-Based Services 1915(c).

What other funding opportunities are available for rural home-based services and community supports?

Local agencies such as Area Agencies on Aging, Aging and Disability Resource Centers, Centers for Independent Living and nonprofit or faith-based organizations are often the best funding sources for rural home-based services. For a list of grant programs and organizations that have funded activities to support aging in place and independent living, see the Funding & Opportunities section of this topic guide.

What are some food and nutrition programs for seniors in rural communities who spend most of their time at home?

The Administration for Community Living's Administration on Aging administers the Nutrition Services Program, which provides grants to states to promote nutrition services programs for older adults. These include:

Home-delivered meals

Meals served in group settings, such as community centers

Nutrition screening

Assessment

Education

Counseling

The programs are intended to reach people age 60 and above who have the greatest social and economic needs. Section 339 of the Older Americans Act of 1965 provides nutrition services programs the ability to also serve spouses of any age, people who provide volunteer services during meal hours, and people with disabilities. Priority is given to the following groups:

Low-income adults

Members of minority groups

Seniors in rural areas

Seniors who have limited proficiency in English

Seniors at risk for needing institutional care

According to the Administration on Community Living (ACL), “home-delivered meals are often the first in-home service that an older adult receives, and the program is a primary access point for other home and community-based services.” A 2015 research brief, Older Americans Benefit from Older Americans Act Nutrition Programs, highlights the connection between the health and ability of recipients of these services to remain at home.

Meals on Wheels America has more than two million staff members and volunteers who deliver meals to frail, homebound, or isolated seniors. The organization notes on its website that it serves “virtually every community in America,” and provides funding, leadership, education, research, and advocacy support.

Some rural communities have food pantries, which may provide food and other basic products. The Rural Monitor article Food Pantries Serving More and More of the Rural Poor gives examples of rural food pantry programs which are funded by federal programs, state governments, foundations, businesses, religious organizations, and individuals.

For more information about nutrition programs for rural seniors, see RHIhub's Rural Hunger and Access to Healthy Food topic guide.

Where can I find information on community-based transportation services?

People in rural areas often have difficulty finding adequate transportation. Those with medical needs requiring specialized care available only in larger communities may find it particularly challenging to access affordable, long-distance transportation to these locations.

The National Aging and Disability Transportation Center (NADTC), a partnership between the Federal Transit Administration, Easterseals, and the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging, promotes transportation availability and accessibility for older adults, people with disabilities, and their caregivers. It offers training and webinars, and Resources & Publications that are available for download.

The National Rural Transit Assistance Program Directory of State RTAP Managers offers a searchable directory of state Rural Transit Assistance Program managers, and VirtualCAP provides information and resources used by Community Action Agencies to help people become self-sufficient in rural and urban areas.

Español 中文 한국의 Tagalog Tiếng Việt

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized three COVID-19 vaccines for emergency use. The vaccines are:

Emergency use authorization (EUA) allows these vaccines to be distributed in the U.S. Learn more about EUAs for COVID-19 vaccines from the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER).

Who authorizes COVID-19 vaccines for emergency use?

The FDA is the authority that has regulatory oversight of the safety, effectiveness and quality of vaccines that are used in the U.S., including COVID-19 vaccines. FDA employees who are career scientists and doctors are the people who decided to authorize COVID-19 vaccines after they thoroughly analyzed and evaluated the data on COVID-19 vaccine safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality.

The FDA may issue an EUA when the agency’s scientific experts have determined that the known and potential benefits of the vaccine outweigh its known and potential risks. FDA employees are fathers, mothers, daughters, sons, sisters, brothers and more. They and their families are directly impacted by the work they do.

Why should I get a COVID-19 vaccine?

When you get a COVID-19 vaccine, you are choosing to protect yourself and make a difference for your children, parents, grandparents, and other loved ones. Millions of people in the U.S. have already received a COVID-19 vaccine. For a community to be fully protected, most community members need to get the vaccine. Getting vaccinated to prevent COVID-19 will help protect you from COVID-19, and it may also protect the people around you.

How do I get a COVID-19 vaccine?

Go to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website to find your state and local health departments who are responsible for COVID-19 vaccine distribution. All questions and concerns should be sent to your state government or local health department. The U.S. government’s goal is to have enough COVID-19 vaccine doses for all people in the U.S. who choose to be vaccinated.

FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines are being distributed for free by states and local communities. If you see vaccines for sale online, or if someone asks you for money to get a vaccine appointment, to put your name on a waiting list, or to get access to a vaccine, it is a scam. You do not need to pay to get a vaccine appointment or to be put on a waiting list.

Do the COVID-19 vaccines work?

Yes. All three FDA-authorized vaccines are effective in preventing COVID-19 and related serious outcomes, including hospitalization and deaths. The FDA thoroughly evaluated and analyzed the safety and effectiveness data for all of the authorized COVID-19 vaccines and determined that the available data for each vaccine provides clear evidence that the known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks of each vaccine.

Do the COVID-19 vaccines work against the new variants?

The available information suggests that the authorized vaccines remain effective in protecting the American public against currently circulating strains of COVID-19. We are already talking with vaccine manufacturers about these new strains and how to quickly and safely make any changes that may be needed in the future.

Some variants spread more easily than others and are more transmissible than the original virus that causes COVID-19. To help slow the spread of COVID-19, get a COVID-19 vaccine when it is available to you. Other ways to slow the spread include:

Wearing a mask

Keeping 6 feet apart from others who don’t live with you

Avoiding crowds and poorly ventilated indoor spaces

Washing your hands often with soap and water (use hand sanitizer if soap and water aren’t available)

How safe are the COVID-19 vaccines?

The FDA evaluated data from clinical studies that included tens of thousands of people for each COVID-19 vaccine. The FDA authorized the vaccines because the data from these studies clearly showed that the known and potential benefits of the FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines outweighed the known and potential risks.



Report vaccine side effects toll-free at 1-800-822-7967 or online to FDA/CDC Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).

Millions of doses of FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines have been given to people all around the country. Serious adverse events following vaccination are very rare. Allergic reactions, some of which are severe, and cases of anaphylaxis have occurred following administration of COVID-19 vaccines. Anaphylaxis is a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction that happens within seconds or minutes of exposure to an allergen. Because of this remote chance of severe allergic reaction or anaphylaxis, health care providers may ask you to stay at the place where you received your COVID-19 vaccine for monitoring for 15 to 30 minutes.

For one vaccine, the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine, there have been cases reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) of a type of blood clot called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) in combination with low levels of platelets in the blood (thrombocytopenia). CVST occurs when a blood clot forms in the brain's venous sinuses. This prevents blood from draining out of the brain. It is a type of rare stroke.

On April 13, 2021, the FDA and CDC recommended a pause in the use of this vaccine out of an abundance of caution while it further investigates these cases and to ensure that the health care provider community is aware of the potential for these adverse events and can plan for proper recognition and management due to the unique treatment required with this type of blood clot.

Can I see the safety and effectiveness data that support the Emergency Use Authorization of the COVID-19 vaccines?

The FDA is publicly sharing information about COVID-19 vaccines so you can see the evidence for yourself. The FDA’s analysis of clinical trial data, as well as demographic information about the clinical study volunteers, is available in the FDA Briefing Document for each vaccine. You can also view the advisory committee webcasts where outside experts discuss the data. The FDA’s reasoning for authorizing each vaccine is available in the FDA Decision Memorandum.

Does the FDA monitor COVID-19 vaccine safety after authorization?

Yes. The FDA and the CDC have several systems in place to continually monitor COVID-19 vaccine safety. These systems, called “passive surveillance” and “active surveillance” systems, rapidly detect and investigate potential safety problems. Systems such as the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and CDC’s text-based v-safe system, which receive reports of adverse events following vaccination, are examples of passive surveillance systems. The FDA‘s BEST Initiative is an example of an active surveillance system, which can rapidly analyze information occurring in millions of individuals recorded in large data systems to investigate any safety signals that are identified by VAERS or v-safe.

153,How Radiation Therapy Is Used to Treat Cancer,"How Radiation Therapy Is Used to Treat Cancer

Radiation is one of the most common treatments for cancer. Other names for radiation treatment are radiation therapy, radiotherapy, irradiation, and x-ray therapy.

What is radiation therapy?

Radiation therapy uses high-energy particles or waves, such as x-rays, gamma rays, electron beams, or protons, to destroy or damage cancer cells.

Your cells normally grow and divide to form new cells. But cancer cells grow and divide faster than most normal cells. Radiation works by making small breaks in the DNA inside cells. These breaks keep cancer cells from growing and dividing and cause them to die. Nearby normal cells can also be affected by radiation, but most recover and go back to working the way they should.

While chemotherapy and other treatments that are taken by mouth or injection usually expose the whole body to cancer-fighting drugs, radiation therapy is usually a local treatment. This means it’s usually aimed at and affects only the part of the body needing treatment. Radiation treatments are planned so that they damage cancer cells with as little harm as possible to nearby healthy cells.

Some radiation treatments (systemic radiation therapy) use radioactive substances that are given in a vein or by mouth. Even though this type of radiation does travel throughout the body, the radioactive substance mostly collects in the area of the tumor, so there’s still little effect on the rest of the body.

Who gets radiation therapy?

More than half of people with cancer get radiation therapy. Sometimes, radiation therapy is the only cancer treatment needed and sometimes it's used with other types of treatment. The decision to use radiation therapy depends on the type and stage of cancer, and other health problems a patient might have.

What are the goals of radiation therapy?

Most types of radiation therapy don’t reach all parts of the body, which means they’re not helpful in treating cancer that has spread to many places within the body. Still, radiation therapy can be used to treat many types of cancer either alone or in combination with other treatments. While it's important to remember each cancer and each person is different, radiation is often the treatment of choice for the following purposes.

To cure or shrink early-stage cancer

Some cancers are very sensitive to radiation. Radiation may be used by itself in these cases to make the cancer shrink or completely go away. In some cases, chemotherapy or other anti-cancer drugs may be given first. For other cancers, radiation may be used before surgery to shrink the tumor (this is called pre-operative therapy or neoadjuvant therapy), or after surgery to help keep the cancer from coming back (called adjuvant therapy).

For certain cancers that can be cured either by radiation or by surgery, radiation may be the preferred treatment. This is because radiation can cause less damage and the part of the body involved may be more likely to work the way it should after treatment.

For some types of cancer, radiation and chemotherapy or other types of anti-cancer drugs might be used together. Certain drugs (called radiosensitizers) help radiation work better by making cancer cells more sensitive to radiation. Research has shown that when anti-cancer drugs and radiation are given together for certain types of cancer, they can help each other work even better than if they were given alone. One drawback, though, is that side effects are often worse when they are given together.

To stop cancer from coming back (recurring) somewhere else

Cancer can spread from where it started to other body parts. Doctors often assume that a few cancer cells might already have spread even when they can’t be seen on imaging scans like CT scans or MRIs. In some cases, the area where the cancer most often spreads to may be treated with radiation to kill any cancer cells before they grow into tumors. For instance, people with certain kinds of lung cancer may get radiation to the head, even when there is no cancer known to be there, because their type of lung cancer often spreads to the brain. This is done to help prevent cancer from spreading to the head even before it can. Sometimes, radiation to prevent future cancer can be given at the same time that radiation is given to treat existing cancer, especially if the area the cancer might spread to is close to the tumor itself.

To treat symptoms caused by advanced cancer

Sometimes cancer has spread too much to be cured. But some of these tumors can still be treated to make them smaller so that the person can feel better. Radiation might help relieve problems like pain, trouble swallowing or breathing, or bowel blockages that can be caused by advanced cancer. This is called palliative radiation.

To treat cancer that has returned (recurred)

If a person's cancer has returned (recurred), radiation might be used to treat the cancer or to treat symptoms caused by advanced cancer. Whether radiation will be used after recurrence depends on many factors. For instance, if the cancer has come back in a part of the body that has already been treated with radiation, it might not be possible to give more radiation in the same place. It depends on the amount of radiation that was used before. In other instances, radiation might be used in the same area of the body or a different area. Some tumors do not respond as well to radiation, so radiation might not be used even if they recur.

How is radiation therapy given?

Radiation therapy can be given in 3 ways:

External radiation (or external beam radiation) : uses a machine that directs high-energy rays from outside the body into the tumor. It’s done during outpatient visits to a hospital or treatment center. It's usually given over many weeks and sometimes will be given twice a day for several weeks. A person receiving external radiation is not radioactive and does not have to follow special safety precautions at home.

It's usually given over many weeks and sometimes will be given twice a day for several weeks. A person receiving external radiation is not radioactive and does not have to follow special safety precautions at home. Internal radiation: Internal radiation is also called brachytherapy. A radioactive source is put inside the body into or near the tumor. With some types of brachytherapy, radiation might be placed and left in the body to work. Sometimes it is placed in the body for a period of time and then removed. This is decided based on the type of cancer. Special safety precautions are needed for this type of radiation for a period of time. But it's important to know if the internal radiation is left in the body, after a while it eventually is no longer radioactive.

Systemic radiation: Radioactive drugs given by mouth or put into a vein are used to treat certain types of cancer. These drugs then travel throughout the body. You might have to follow special precautions at home for a period of time after these drugs are given.

The type of radiation you might get depends on the kind of cancer you have and where it is. In some cases, more than one type is used. Your cancer care team can answer specific questions about the type of radiation prescribed for you, how it affects your body, and any precautions that may be needed.

Who gives radiation therapy treatments?

During your radiation therapy, a team of highly trained medical professionals will care for you. Your team may include these people:

Radiation oncologist: This doctor is specially trained to treat cancer with radiation. This person oversees your radiation treatment plan.

This doctor is specially trained to treat cancer with radiation. This person oversees your radiation treatment plan. Radiation physicist: This is the person who makes sure the radiation equipment is working as it should and that it gives you the exact dose prescribed by your radiation oncologist.

This person operates the radiation equipment and positions you for each treatment. Radiation therapy nurse: This nurse has special training in cancer treatment and can give you information about radiation treatment and managing side effects.

You may also need the services of a dietitian, physical therapist, social worker, dentist or dental oncologist, pharmacist, or other health care providers.

Does radiation therapy cause cancer?

It has long been known that radiation therapy can slightly raise the risk of getting another cancer. It’s one of the possible side effects of treatment that doctors have to think about when they weigh the benefits and risks of each treatment. For the most part, the risk of a second cancer from these treatments is small and is outweighed by the benefit of treating the cancer, but the risk is not zero. This is one of the many reasons each case is different and each person must be part of deciding which kind of treatment is right for them. The risk is different depending on where the radiation treatment will be in the body.

If your cancer care team recommends radiation treatment, it’s because they believe that the benefits you’ll get from it will outweigh the possible side effects. Still, this is your decision to make. Knowing as much as you can about the possible benefits and risks can help you be sure that radiation therapy is best for you.

Does radiation therapy affect pregnancy or fertility?

Females: It’s important not to become pregnant while getting radiation – it can harm the growing baby. If there’s a chance you might become pregnant, be sure to talk to your doctor about birth control options.

If you are or might be pregnant, let your doctor know right away.

If the area getting radiation in your body includes the ovaries, it is possible that the dose of radiation can cause the ovaries to no longer work (sterility), and that you would be unable to have children. it is important to know the risk of this possibility in advance of receiving radiation therapy. If you are thinking about radiation therapy that will affect the ovaries, talk to your doctor about how this might affect having children in the future.

Males: Not much is known about radiation’s effect on the children conceived by men while getting radiation therapy. Because of this, doctors often advise men to not get a woman pregnant during and for some weeks after treatment. Talk to your doctor to find out more about this.

If the area getting radiation includes the testicles, it is possible that the dose of radiation can cause the testicles to no longer work (sterility) and that you would be unable to have children. It is important to know the risk of this possibility in advance of receiving radiation therapy. There is no clear research about how sperm that is exposed to radiation affects future children made from that sperm. If you are thinking about radiation therapy that will affect the testicles, talk to your doctor about how this might affect having children in the future.

Questions to ask about radiation therapy

Before treatment, you’ll be asked to sign a consent form saying that your doctor has explained how radiation therapy may help, the possible risks, the type of radiation to be used, and your other treatment options. Before signing the consent form, be sure that you have had a chance to get all your questions answered. Here are some of the things you may want to ask about:",www.cancer.org
154,What Are mRNA Vaccines and How Do They Work?,"Vaccines help prepare the body to fight foreign invaders (pathogens such as bacteria or viruses), to prevent infection. All vaccines introduce into the body a harmless piece of a particular bacteria or virus, triggering an immune response. Most vaccines contain a weakened or killed bacteria or virus. However, scientists have developed a new type of vaccine that uses a molecule called messenger RNA (or mRNA for short) rather than part of an actual bacteria or virus. Messenger RNA is a type of RNA that is necessary for protein production. In cells, mRNA uses the information in genes to create a blueprint for making proteins. Once cells finish making a protein, they quickly break down the mRNA. mRNA from vaccines does not enter the nucleus and does not alter DNA.

mRNA vaccines work by introducing a piece of mRNA that corresponds to a viral protein, usually a small piece of a protein found on the virus’s outer membrane. (Individuals who get an mRNA vaccine are not exposed to the virus, nor can they become infected by it.) Using this mRNA blueprint, cells produce the viral protein. As part of a normal immune response, the immune system recognizes that the protein is foreign and produces specialized proteins called antibodies. Antibodies help protect the body against infection by recognizing individual viruses or other pathogens, attaching to them, and marking the pathogens for destruction. Once produced, antibodies remain in the body, even after the body has rid itself of the pathogen, so that the immune system can quickly respond if exposed again. If a person is exposed to a virus after receiving mRNA vaccination for it, antibodies can quickly recognize it, attach to it, and mark it for destruction before it can cause serious illness.

Like all vaccines in the United States, mRNA vaccines require authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before they can be used. Currently vaccines for COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, are the only authorized mRNA vaccines. These vaccines use mRNA that directs cells to produce copies of a protein on the outside of the coronavirus known as the “spike protein”. Researchers are studying how mRNA might be used to develop vaccines for additional infectious diseases.",medlineplus.gov

Facebook Twitter Linkedin Pinterest Print

What is cerebral venous sinus thrombosis? Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) occurs when a blood clot forms in the brain’s venous sinuses. This prevents blood from draining out of the brain. As a result, blood cells may break and leak blood into the brain tissues, forming a hemorrhage. This chain of events is part of a stroke that can occur in adults and children. It can occur even in newborns and babies in the womb. A stroke can damage the brain and central nervous system. A stroke is serious and requires immediate medical attention. This condition may also be called cerebral sinovenous thrombosis. What causes cerebral venous sinus thrombosis? CVST is a rare form of stroke. It affects about 5 people in 1 million each year. The risk for this kind of stroke in newborns is greatest during the first month. Overall, about 3 out of 300,000 children and teens up to age 18 will have a stroke.

What are the risk factors for cerebral venous sinus thrombosis? Children and adults have different risk factors for CVST. Risk factors for children and infants include: Problems with the way their blood forms clots

Sickle cell anemia

Chronic hemolytic anemia

Beta-thalassemia major

Heart disease — either congenital (you're born with it) or acquired (you develop it)

Iron deficiency

Certain infections

Dehydration

Head injury

For newborns, a mother who had certain infections or a history of infertility Risk factors for adults include: Pregnancy and the first few weeks after delivery

Problems with blood clotting; for example, antiphospholipid syndrome, protein C and S deficiency, antithrombin III deficiency, lupus anticoagulant, or factor V Leiden mutation

Cancer

Collagen vascular diseases like lupus, Wegener’s granulomatosis, and Behcet syndrome

Obesity

Low blood pressure in the brain (intracranial hypotension)

Inflammatory bowel disease like Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis What are the symptoms of cerebral venous thrombosis? Symptoms of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis may vary, depending on the location of the thrombus. Responding quickly to these symptoms makes it more possible to recover. These are the physical symptoms that may occur: Headache

Blurred vision

Fainting or loss of consciousness

Loss of control over movement in part of the body

Seizures

Coma How is cerebral venous sinus thrombosis diagnosed? People who have had any type of stroke recover best if they get treatment immediately. If you suspect a stroke based on the symptoms, have someone take you immediately to the emergency room, or call 911 to get help. Doctors typically take a medical history and do a physical exam. Family and friends can describe the symptoms they saw, especially if the person who had the stroke is unconscious. The final diagnosis, however, is usually made based on how the blood is flowing in the brain. Imaging tests show areas of blood flow. These tests may be used to diagnose venous sinus thrombosis: MRI scan

CT scan

Venography

Angiography

Ultrasound

156,Recommendation to Pause Use of Johnson & Johnson's Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine,"Since use of COVID-19 vaccines began in the United States, scientists and doctors have constantly and carefully reviewed all reports of vaccine side effects and adverse events. As of April 23, 2021, more than 8 million doses of the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine had been given in the United States. As of April 23, 2021, experts reviewing safety reports for this vaccine found 15 reports of women who got the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine and later developed thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). TTS is a serious condition that involves blood clots with low platelets.

These reports suggest an increased risk of TTS one to two weeks after vaccination with the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. As of April 23, 2021, the reports reviewed all occurred in women between 18 and 59 years old, with a median of 37 years. These reports represent a reporting rate of 7 such events per 1 million vaccinations among women 18 through 49 years old and a rate of 0.9 per 1 million vaccinations among women 50 years and older. For all women, this is a rare adverse event. For women 50 years and older and men of all ages, the adverse event is even more rare. Reports show that symptoms of this adverse event started between 6 and 15 days after vaccination.",www.cdc.gov

What Is a Gene Mutation?

A gene mutation (myoo-TAY-shun) is a change in one or more genes. Some mutations can lead to genetic disorders or illnesses.

What Are Genes?

Genes are short sections of DNA. They determine our traits, which are things like hair color, height, body type, and other things that make a person unique. Genes also play a role in a person's risk for some diseases and health conditions. Each of us has about 24,000 different types of genes.

What Is DNA?

DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is the carrier of all our genes. Each person gets one copy of DNA from their mother and one copy from their father. DNA creates a code using four chemicals called nucleotides (NEW-klee-uh-tydes). This code determines which genes a person has. DNA is located inside the chromosomes.

What Is a Chromosome?

A chromosome (KRO-muh-sohm) is an X-shaped thread-like structure in the body's cells. It contains DNA. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes.

What Causes a Gene Mutation?

A gene can mutate because of:

a change in one or more nucleotides of DNA

a change in many genes

loss of one or more genes

rearrangement of genes or whole chromosomes

Do Parents Pass Gene Mutations to Children?

If a parent carries a gene mutation in their egg or sperm, it can pass to their child. These hereditary (or inherited) mutations are in almost every cell of the person's body throughout their life. Hereditary mutations include cystic fibrosis, hemophilia, and sickle cell disease.

Other mutations can happen on their own during a person's life. These are called sporadic, spontaneous, or new mutations. They affect only some cells. Damage from the sun's ultraviolet radiation or exposure to some types of chemicals can lead to new mutations. These mutations are not passed from parents to their children.

Do All Gene Mutations Cause Health Problems?

Most gene mutations have no effect on health. And the body can repair many mutations. Some mutations are even helpful. For example, people can have a mutation that protects them from heart disease or gives them harder bones.",kidshealth.org

Parents do everything they can to protect their children. But sadly, many kids have gone through trauma.

A trauma is any event that is deeply upsetting, scary, or harmful. Things like abuse, violence, accidents, or natural disasters can be traumas. Becoming homeless, losing a parent, or a serious illness can be traumas too.

Traumas are serious events that cause kids to fear for their life or safety.

After a trauma, the emotional effects can last a long time. It can be hard to move on. For some kids, trauma can lead to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

But kids can recover after trauma. There is therapy that can help. Kids also need extra support and comfort from parents.

How Does Trauma Affect Kids?

Trauma affects a child's sense of safety and trust. After a trauma, kids can still feel tense or scared. Some feel alone, sad, angry, or guilty. They may think they are to blame for what happened to them. For some kids, there's a loss of self-esteem or dignity. For some, there's deep grief.

Trauma also can affect a child's mood, behavior, or sleep. Some kids become depressed. They might act grumpy or seem sad. Some get in trouble more often or do worse in school. Some have new fears or trouble sleeping. Some have upsetting memories, called flashbacks. Often, kids avoid things that remind them of what they've been through.

After a trauma, some kids share how they feel. But other kids keep things to themselves. They may try to hide how they feel, or try to push it out of their minds. They may think others expect them to ""get over it."" Some just don't have words for their feelings. For any of these reasons, a parent might not know what their child is going through.

How Does Therapy Help Kids Heal After a Trauma?

Therapy gives kids a way to safely share their feelings, tell their story, and get support. In therapy, kids learn to talk about what they've been through. They learn coping and calming skills. They learn to adjust the way they think and feel about the trauma. Slowly, they learn to face things they used to avoid. Therapy helps kids find their own courage and gain confidence.

Child therapy for trauma is called trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (or TF-CBT). Therapy includes talk, play, and learning activities that heal trauma.

TF-CBT helps parents too. It's natural for parents to feel upset about what their child has been through. In therapy, parents get the support they need. They get advice on how to help their child at home.

In TF-CBT, parents can play a big role in their child's healing. They are coached to listen in ways that help their child open up, talk, and feel close. They help their child practice coping skills at home. They share in the good feelings as their child makes progress.

How Can I Find Therapy for My Child?

Talk to your child's doctor. Let them know what your child has been through. The doctor cares about your child's mental health too.

Ask the doctor to refer you to a trained child therapist who can help. You might need to take your child to therapy once a week for a few months. But you'll see progress along the way.

How Can I Give My Child the Extra Support They Need?

After a trauma, kids need your support and comfort more than ever. Be sure to:

Spend time with your child. Do things that are soothing, relaxing, or fun. Cook together, take a walk, play, read, make art, or sing. Try to do this every day, even if it's only for a few minutes.

Show them how to try again.

Use hugs, smiles, words, and caring actions to show your love. Use soothing words and offer comfort when your child is upset.

Use hugs, smiles, words, and caring actions to show your love. Use soothing words and offer comfort when your child is upset. Have soothing routines. Take a few minutes at bedtime (or any time) to read a story, snuggle together, or sing to your young child. For older kids, make it a routine to give a good night hug, along with a few minutes to talk, listen, or laugh together. Those extra few minutes with you can help your child feel calm, safe, and relaxed.

These may seem like small things — things you already do. But giving extra support and time keeps your child feeling loved and close to you. After a trauma, that closeness matters more than ever.",kidshealth.org
159,What Can Parents Do about Heavy Metals in Baby Food?,"

Larger text size Large text size Regular text size

Print

I've heard about heavy metals in baby food. How can I keep my baby safe?

- Keeley

Heavy metals are found in soil, water, and the air we breathe. Plants take up these metals as they grow and can end up in the food we eat. Our bodies need some heavy metals (like iron and zinc) to work well, but other heavy metals (like arsenic and lead) are harmful. Some crops, like rice, absorb more of these harmful metals than others. Heavy metals can build up in the body over time and cause problems with learning, behavior, and attention.

When making baby food, companies add vitamins and minerals along with food additives that may contain heavy metals. Some baby foods have higher levels of heavy metals than others, including:

infant rice cereal

infant rice puff snacks

teething biscuits and rice rusks

fruit juice

carrots and sweet potatoes

Even organic baby food can have heavy metals in it.

The amount of heavy metals is low in baby foods, but you can take steps to lower it even more. Here are ways to do that:",kidshealth.org

CDC and FDA do not provide individual medical treatment, advice, or diagnosis. If you need individual medical or health care advice, consult a qualified healthcare provider.",vaers.hhs.gov
168,Platelet Tests,"What are platelet tests?

Platelets, also known as thrombocytes, are small blood cells that are essential for blood clotting. Clotting is the process that helps you stop bleeding after an injury. There are two types of platelet tests: a platelet count test and platelet function tests.

A platelet count test measures the number of platelets in your blood. A lower than normal platelet count is called thrombocytopenia. This condition can cause you to bleed too much after a cut or other injury that causes bleeding. A higher than normal platelet count is called thrombocytosis. This can make your blood clot more than you need it to. Blood clots can be dangerous because they can block blood flow.

Platelet function tests check your platelets' ability to form clots. Platelet function tests include:

Closure time. This test measures the time it takes for platelets in a blood sample to plug a small hole in a tiny tube. It helps screen for different platelet disorders.

This test measures the time it takes for platelets in a blood sample to plug a small hole in a tiny tube. It helps screen for different platelet disorders. Viscoelastometry. This test measures the strength of a blood clot as it forms. A blood clot has to be strong to stop bleeding.

This test measures the strength of a blood clot as it forms. A blood clot has to be strong to stop bleeding. Platelet aggregometry. This is a group of tests that are used to measure how well platelets clump together (aggregate).

This is a group of tests that are used to measure how well platelets clump together (aggregate). Lumiaggregometry. This test measures the amount of light produced when certain substances are added to a blood sample. It can help show if there are defects in the platelets.

This test measures the amount of light produced when certain substances are added to a blood sample. It can help show if there are defects in the platelets. Flow cytometry. This is a test that uses lasers to look for proteins on the surface of platelets. It can help diagnose inherited platelet disorders. This is a specialized test. It is only available at certain hospitals and laboratories.

This is a test that uses lasers to look for proteins on the surface of platelets. It can help diagnose inherited platelet disorders. This is a specialized test. It is only available at certain hospitals and laboratories. Bleeding time. This test measures the amount of time for bleeding to stop after small cuts are made in the forearm. It was once commonly used to screen for a variety of platelet disorders. Now, other platelet function tests are used more often. The newer tests provide more reliable results.

Other names: platelet count, thrombocyte count, platelet function tests, platelet function assay, platelet aggregation studies",medlineplus.gov
169,How to Prepare for a Lab Test,"How do I prepare for a lab test?

A laboratory (lab) test is a procedure in which a health care provider takes a sample of your blood, urine, other body fluid, or body tissue to get information about your health. Lab tests are often used to help diagnose or screen for a specific disease or condition. Screening helps diagnose diseases before symptoms occur. Other tests are used to monitor a disease or see if treatment is effective. Lab tests may also be done to provide more general information about your organs and body systems.

For any type of lab test, you should prepare for it by:

Following all the instructions given to you by your health care provider

Telling your provider or lab professional if you didn't follow these instructions exactly. It's important to be honest. Even a minor change from the instructions can have a big effect on your results. For example, some medicines raise or lower blood sugar levels. Taking them too close to a blood sugar test could affect your results.

Telling your provider about any medicines, vitamins, or supplements that you are taking

Taking these steps can help ensure your results will be accurate and reliable.",medlineplus.gov
170,What You Need to Know About Blood Testing,"What happens during a blood test?

A health care provider will need to take a sample of your blood. This is also called a blood draw. When a blood draw is taken from a vein, it's known as venipuncture.

During venipuncture, a lab professional, known as a phlebotomist, will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.

Venipuncture is the most common way to do a blood test.

Other ways to do a blood test are:",medlineplus.gov
171,How to Cope with Medical Test Anxiety,"What is medical test anxiety?

Medical test anxiety is a fear of medical tests. Medical tests are procedures that are used to diagnose, screen for, or monitor various diseases and conditions. While many people sometimes feel nervous or uncomfortable about testing, it doesn't usually cause serious problems or symptoms.

Medical test anxiety can be serious. It can become a type of phobia. A phobia is an anxiety disorder that causes an intense, irrational fear of something that poses little or no actual danger. Phobias can also cause physical symptoms such as rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, and trembling.",medlineplus.gov
172,How to Prepare Your Child for a Lab Test,"What happens to my child during a lab test?

Common lab tests for children include blood tests, urine tests, swab tests, and throat cultures.

Blood tests are used to test for many different diseases and conditions. During a blood test, a sample will be taken from a vein in the arm, a fingertip, or a heel.

If done on a vein , a health care professional will take a sample, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial.

, a health care professional will take a sample, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. A fingertip blood test is done by pricking your child's fingertip.

test is done by pricking your child's fingertip. Heel stick tests are used for newborn screenings, a test given shortly after birth to almost every baby born in the United States. Newborn screenings are used to help diagnose a variety of serious health conditions. During a heel stick test, a health care provider will clean your baby's heel with alcohol and poke the heel with a small needle.

During a blood test, encourage your child to look at you, rather than at the person drawing the blood. You should also provide physical comfort and distraction.

Urine tests are done to check for different diseases and for infections of the urinary tract. During a urine test, your child will need to provide a urine sample in a special cup. Unless your child has an infection or a rash, a urine test is not painful. But it can be stressful. The following tips may help.

Talk to your child's provider to find out if a ""clean catch"" method will be needed. For a clean catch urine sample, your child will need to: Clean their genital area with a cleansing pad Start to urinate into the toilet Move the collection container under the urine stream Collect at least an ounce or two of urine into the container, which should have markings to indicate the amounts Finish urinating into the toilet

If a clean catch sample is needed, practice at home. Ask your child to let out a bit of urine in the toilet, stop the flow, and start again.

Encourage your child to drink water before the appointment, but not go to the bathroom. This may make it easier to urinate when it's time to collect the sample.

Turn on the tap. The sound of running water can help your child begin to urinate.

Swab tests help diagnose different types of respiratory infections. During a swab test, a health care provider will:

Gently insert a cotton-tipped swab inside your child's nostril. For some swab tests, a provider may need to insert the swab deeper, until the reaches the uppermost part of the nose and throat, known as the nasopharynx.

Rotate the swab and leave it in place for 10-15 seconds.

Remove the swab and insert into the other nostril.

Swab the second nostril using the same technique.

Swab tests may tickle the throat or cause your child to cough. A swab of the nasopharynx may be uncomfortable and cause a gag reflex when the swab touches the throat. Let your child know beforehand that gagging may happen, but it will be over quickly. It may also help to tell your child that the swab is similar to the cotton swabs you have at home.

Throat cultures are done to check for bacterial infections of the throat, including strep throat. During a throat culture:

Your child will be asked to tilt their head back and open their mouth as wide as possible.

Your child's provider will use a tongue depressor to hold down your child's tongue.

The provider will use a special swab to take a sample from the back of the throat and tonsils.

A throat swab isn't painful, but like some swab tests, it can cause gagging. Let your child know what to expect and that any discomfort shouldn't last very long.",medlineplus.gov
173,Catecholamine Tests,"What happens during a catecholamine test?

A catecholamine test may be done in urine or blood. Urine testing is done more often because catecholamine blood levels can change quickly and may also be affected by the stress of testing.

But blood testing can be useful in helping to diagnose a pheochromocytoma tumor. If you have this tumor, certain substances will be released into the bloodstream.

For a catecholamine urine test, your health care provider will ask you to collect all urine during a 24-hour period. This is called a 24-hour urine sample test. For 24-hour urine sample test, your health care provider or a laboratory professional will give you a container to collect your urine and instructions on how to collect and store your samples. Test instructions usually include the following steps:

Empty your bladder in the morning and flush that urine away. Record the time.

For the next 24 hours, save all your urine passed in the container provided.

Store your urine container in the refrigerator or a cooler with ice.

Return the sample container to your health provider's office or the laboratory as instructed.

During a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.",medlineplus.gov
174,Antibiotic Sensitivity Test,"What is an antibiotic sensitivity test?

Antibiotics are medicines used to fight bacterial infections. There are different types of antibiotics. Each type is only effective against certain bacteria. An antibiotic sensitivity test can help find out which antibiotic will be most effective in treating your infection.

The test can also be helpful in finding a treatment for antibiotic-resistant infections. Antibiotic resistance happens when standard antibiotics become less effective or ineffective against certain bacteria. Antibiotic resistance can turn once easily treatable diseases into serious, even life-threatening illnesses.

Other names: antibiotic susceptibility test, sensitivity testing, antimicrobial susceptibility test",medlineplus.gov
175,Xylose Testing,"What happens during a xylose test?

A xylose test involves getting samples from both blood and urine. You will be tested before and after you drink a solution that contains 8 ounces of water that is mixed with a small amount of xylose.

For the blood tests:

A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial.

Next, you will drink the xylose solution.

You will be asked to rest quietly.

Your provider will give you another blood test two hours later. For children, it may be one hour later.

For the urine tests, you will need to collect all the urine you produce for five hours after you have taken the xylose solution. Your health care provider will give you instructions on how to collect your urine during the five-hour period.",medlineplus.gov
176,Measuring Blood Pressure,"What do the results mean?

Your results, also known as a blood pressure reading, will contain two numbers. The top or first number is the systolic pressure. The bottom or second number is the diastolic pressure. High blood pressure readings are also labeled by categories, ranging from normal to crisis. Your reading may show your blood pressure is:

Blood Pressure Category Systolic Blood Pressure

Diastolic Blood Pressure Normal Less than 120 and Less than 80 High Blood Pressure (no other heart risk factors) 140 or higher or 90 or higher High Blood Pressure (with other heart risk factors, according to some providers) 130 or higher or 80 or higher Dangerously high blood pressure - seek medical care right away 180 or higher and 120 or higher

If you've been diagnosed with high blood pressure, your provider may recommend lifestyle changes and/or medicines to control your blood pressure. Your provider may also recommend that you regularly check your blood pressure at home with an automated blood pressure monitor. An at-home blood pressure monitor usually includes a blood pressure cuff and a digital device to record and display blood pressure readings.

Home monitoring is not a replacement for regular visits to your provider. But it can provide important information, such as whether treatment is working or your condition may have worsened. Also, home monitoring may make the test less stressful. Many people get nervous about getting their blood pressure taken at a provider's office. This is called ""white coat syndrome."" It can cause a temporary rise in blood pressure, making the results less accurate. For more information about home monitoring of blood pressure, talk to your provider.

If you were tested for low blood pressure, a blood pressure reading of 90 systolic, 60 diastolic (90/60) or lower is considered abnormal. Treatments for low blood pressure may include medicines and making certain changes to your diet.",medlineplus.gov
177,Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP),"What is a basic metabolic panel (BMP)?

A basic metabolic panel (BMP) is a test that measures eight different substances in your blood. It provides important information about your body's chemical balance and metabolism. Metabolism is the process of how the body uses food and energy. A BMP includes tests for the following:

Glucose , a type of sugar and your body's main source of energy.

178,FDA and CDC Lift Recommended Pause on Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) COVID-19 Vaccine Use Following Thorough Safety Review,"Following a thorough safety review, including two meetings of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have determined that the recommended pause regarding the use of the Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) COVID-19 Vaccine in the U.S. should be lifted and use of the vaccine should resume.

The pause was recommended after reports of six cases of a rare and severe type of blood clot in individuals following administration of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. During the pause, medical and scientific teams at the FDA and CDC examined available data to assess the risk of thrombosis involving the cerebral venous sinuses, or CVST (large blood vessels in the brain), and other sites in the body (including but not limited to the large blood vessels of the abdomen and the veins of the legs) along with thrombocytopenia, or low blood platelet counts. The teams at FDA and CDC also conducted extensive outreach to providers and clinicians to ensure they were made aware of the potential for these adverse events and could properly manage and recognize these events due to the unique treatment required for these blood clots and low platelets, also known as thrombosis-thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS).

The two agencies have determined the following:

Use of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine should be resumed in the United States.

The FDA and CDC have confidence that this vaccine is safe and effective in preventing COVID-19.

The FDA has determined that the available data show that the vaccine’s known and potential benefits outweigh its known and potential risks in individuals 18 years of age and older.

At this time, the available data suggest that the chance of TTS occurring is very low, but the FDA and CDC will remain vigilant in continuing to investigate this risk.

Health care providers administering the vaccine and vaccine recipients or caregivers should review the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers Administering Vaccine (Vaccination Providers) external icon and Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers external icon , which have been revised to include information about the risk of this syndrome, which has occurred in a very small number of people who have received the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine.

CDC’s independent Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices met today to discuss the latest data on TTS, hearing from the vaccine manufacturer Janssen and the COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Technical (VaST) Subgroup, as well as a risk benefit analysis. ACIP is committed to be vigilant and responsive to additional information that could impact the risk benefit analysis of any of these vaccines. Vaccine safety monitoring will continue and any new information about TTS will be brought to ACIP as needed.

“Safety is our top priority. This pause was an example of our extensive safety monitoring working as they were designed to work—identifying even these small number of cases. We’ve lifted the pause based on the FDA and CDC’s review of all available data and in consultation with medical experts and based on recommendations from the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. We have concluded that the known and potential benefits of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine outweigh its known and potential risks in individuals 18 years of age and older. We are confident that this vaccine continues to meet our standards for safety, effectiveness and quality. We recommend people with questions about which vaccine is right for them have those discussions with their health care provider,” said Janet Woodcock, M.D., Acting FDA Commissioner.

“Above all else, health and safety are at the forefront of our decisions,” said CDC Director Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky. “Our vaccine safety systems are working. We identified exceptionally rare events – out of millions of doses of the Janssen COVID-19 administered – and we paused to examine them more carefully. As we always do, we will continue to watch all signals closely as more Americans are vaccinated. I continue to be encouraged by the growing body of real-world evidence that the authorized COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective, and they protect people from disease, hospitalization, and death. I urge anyone with questions about the COVID-19 vaccines to speak with their healthcare provider or local public health department.”

Assessment of Available Data

Medical and scientific teams at the FDA and CDC reviewed several sources of information and data related to the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine to reach today’s decision.

Specifically, the agencies assessed reports submitted to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS),external icon reviewed the medical literature and considered the information from global regulatory partners about thrombosis with thrombocytopenia that have been reported following use of a similar, yet not identical, COVID-19 vaccine using a virus from the adenovirus family that has been modified to contain the gene for making a protein from SARS-CoV-2.

Update on Adverse Events

On April 13, the FDA and CDC announcedexternal icon that, out of more than 6.8 million doses administered, six reports of a rare and severe type of blood clot combined with low blood platelet levels occurring in people after receiving the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine had been reported to VAERS. In these cases, a type of blood clot called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) was seen in combination with low levels of blood platelets (thrombocytopenia).

Today, the agencies can confirm that a total of 15 cases of TTS have been reported to VAERS, including the original six reported cases. All of these cases occurred in women between the ages of 18 and 59, with a median age of 37 years. Reports indicated symptom onset between 6 and 15 days after vaccination.

Monitoring for Safety Will Continue

The surveillance systems that are in place to monitor the safety of COVID-19 vaccines authorized for emergency use are working, as demonstrated by both agencies’ quick work to identify and investigate these rare, but serious adverse events. The FDA and CDC will continue with these efforts to closely monitor the safety of these vaccines.

Reports of adverse events following vaccination can be made to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting Systemexternal icon.

232,What You Need to Know About Blood Testing,"What happens during a blood test?

A health care provider will need to take a sample of your blood. This is also called a blood draw. When a blood draw is taken from a vein, it's known as venipuncture.

During venipuncture, a lab professional, known as a phlebotomist, will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.

Venipuncture is the most common way to do a blood test.

233,Recommendation to Pause Use of Johnson & Johnson's Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine,"Since use of COVID-19 vaccines began in the United States, scientists and doctors have constantly and carefully reviewed all reports of vaccine side effects and adverse events. As of April 23, 2021, more than 8 million doses of the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine had been given in the United States. As of April 23, 2021, experts reviewing safety reports for this vaccine found 15 reports of women who got the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine and later developed thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). TTS is a serious condition that involves blood clots with low platelets.

These reports suggest an increased risk of TTS one to two weeks after vaccination with the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. As of April 23, 2021, the reports reviewed all occurred in women between 18 and 59 years old, with a median of 37 years. These reports represent a reporting rate of 7 such events per 1 million vaccinations among women 18 through 49 years old and a rate of 0.9 per 1 million vaccinations among women 50 years and older. For all women, this is a rare adverse event. For women 50 years and older and men of all ages, the adverse event is even more rare. Reports show that symptoms of this adverse event started between 6 and 15 days after vaccination.",www.cdc.gov
234,Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis (CVST),"Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis (CVST)

Facebook Twitter Linkedin Pinterest Print

What is cerebral venous sinus thrombosis? Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) occurs when a blood clot forms in the brain’s venous sinuses. This prevents blood from draining out of the brain. As a result, blood cells may break and leak blood into the brain tissues, forming a hemorrhage. This chain of events is part of a stroke that can occur in adults and children. It can occur even in newborns and babies in the womb. A stroke can damage the brain and central nervous system. A stroke is serious and requires immediate medical attention. This condition may also be called cerebral sinovenous thrombosis. What causes cerebral venous sinus thrombosis? CVST is a rare form of stroke. It affects about 5 people in 1 million each year. The risk for this kind of stroke in newborns is greatest during the first month. Overall, about 3 out of 300,000 children and teens up to age 18 will have a stroke.

What are the risk factors for cerebral venous sinus thrombosis? Children and adults have different risk factors for CVST. Risk factors for children and infants include: Problems with the way their blood forms clots

Sickle cell anemia

Chronic hemolytic anemia

Beta-thalassemia major

Heart disease — either congenital (you're born with it) or acquired (you develop it)

Iron deficiency

Certain infections

Dehydration

Head injury

For newborns, a mother who had certain infections or a history of infertility Risk factors for adults include: Pregnancy and the first few weeks after delivery

Problems with blood clotting; for example, antiphospholipid syndrome, protein C and S deficiency, antithrombin III deficiency, lupus anticoagulant, or factor V Leiden mutation

Cancer

Collagen vascular diseases like lupus, Wegener’s granulomatosis, and Behcet syndrome

Obesity

Low blood pressure in the brain (intracranial hypotension)

Inflammatory bowel disease like Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis What are the symptoms of cerebral venous thrombosis? Symptoms of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis may vary, depending on the location of the thrombus. Responding quickly to these symptoms makes it more possible to recover. These are the physical symptoms that may occur: Headache

Blurred vision

Fainting or loss of consciousness

Loss of control over movement in part of the body

Seizures

Coma How is cerebral venous sinus thrombosis diagnosed? People who have had any type of stroke recover best if they get treatment immediately. If you suspect a stroke based on the symptoms, have someone take you immediately to the emergency room, or call 911 to get help. Doctors typically take a medical history and do a physical exam. Family and friends can describe the symptoms they saw, especially if the person who had the stroke is unconscious. The final diagnosis, however, is usually made based on how the blood is flowing in the brain. Imaging tests show areas of blood flow. These tests may be used to diagnose venous sinus thrombosis: MRI scan

CT scan

Venography

Angiography

Ultrasound

Your results, also known as a blood pressure reading, will contain two numbers. The top or first number is the systolic pressure. The bottom or second number is the diastolic pressure. High blood pressure readings are also labeled by categories, ranging from normal to crisis. Your reading may show your blood pressure is:

Blood Pressure Category Systolic Blood Pressure

Diastolic Blood Pressure Normal Less than 120 and Less than 80 High Blood Pressure (no other heart risk factors) 140 or higher or 90 or higher High Blood Pressure (with other heart risk factors, according to some providers) 130 or higher or 80 or higher Dangerously high blood pressure - seek medical care right away 180 or higher and 120 or higher

If you've been diagnosed with high blood pressure, your provider may recommend lifestyle changes and/or medicines to control your blood pressure. Your provider may also recommend that you regularly check your blood pressure at home with an automated blood pressure monitor. An at-home blood pressure monitor usually includes a blood pressure cuff and a digital device to record and display blood pressure readings.

Home monitoring is not a replacement for regular visits to your provider. But it can provide important information, such as whether treatment is working or your condition may have worsened. Also, home monitoring may make the test less stressful. Many people get nervous about getting their blood pressure taken at a provider's office. This is called ""white coat syndrome."" It can cause a temporary rise in blood pressure, making the results less accurate. For more information about home monitoring of blood pressure, talk to your provider.

239,Platelet Tests,"What are platelet tests?

Platelets, also known as thrombocytes, are small blood cells that are essential for blood clotting. Clotting is the process that helps you stop bleeding after an injury. There are two types of platelet tests: a platelet count test and platelet function tests.

A platelet count test measures the number of platelets in your blood. A lower than normal platelet count is called thrombocytopenia. This condition can cause you to bleed too much after a cut or other injury that causes bleeding. A higher than normal platelet count is called thrombocytosis. This can make your blood clot more than you need it to. Blood clots can be dangerous because they can block blood flow.

Platelet function tests check your platelets' ability to form clots. Platelet function tests include:

Closure time. This test measures the time it takes for platelets in a blood sample to plug a small hole in a tiny tube. It helps screen for different platelet disorders.

Identifying the cause of low back pain has become a frequent challenge for medical professionals. It is also what has encouraged Gwendolyn Sowa, M.D., Ph.D., of the University of Pittsburgh to study the topic.

Low back pain is a widespread issue in the U.S. It affects more than 25% of workers, according to a recent national health survey. An injury, working in a physically demanding job, or working in a job where you sit too much can all contribute to back pain.

""It's one of the most common causes of disability both from a quality of life perspective but also from a productivity perspective,"" Dr. Sowa says. ""It has a huge impact on how patients can function in their everyday life, whether that's their work, their home-related activities, or their leisure activities.""

Because of how widespread it is, low back pain also presents an opportunity for researchers.

""The findings on traditional imaging such as X-rays and MRIs often have a very poor correlation with patient symptoms."" – Gwendolyn Sowa, M.D., Ph.D.

An opportunity for change

""It's also one of the areas that we have the biggest opportunity to change the way we care for patients,"" Dr. Sowa explained. One of those opportunities is around identifying contributors to back pain.

""The findings on traditional imaging such as X-rays and MRIs often have a very poor correlation with patient symptoms,"" Dr. Sowa explains. She says that many people who might have physical damage to their low back may not experience any symptoms. On the other hand, some individuals might experience a great deal of low back pain but could have little visible damage.

Through her work supported by the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, Dr. Sowa and her collaborators study better ways to treat people based on their individual symptoms and medical history. This includes looking at factors like genetics, stress, lifestyle, behaviors, and activity levels.

Holistic health for low back pain

Rather than treating one symptom or only looking at one aspect of a person's pain, Dr. Sowa says she and her team aim for a more well-rounded approach.

""We want to develop precision medicine approaches to their treatment that we hope will be more effective and prevent a trial-and-error type of approach to treating these patients,"" Dr. Sowa says.

She adds that the ultimate goal of her research is to decrease unnecessary treatments and increase the chances of finding the right treatment the first time.

""If we don't improve [patients'] function and get their pain under control, they're more likely to progress to chronic back pain,"" she says.

Addressing chronic pain

Dr. Sowa also studies how to better address chronic back pain through the Back Pain Consortium (BACPAC) Research Program of the Helping to End Addiction Long-termSM Initiative, or NIH HEAL InitiativeSM. The NIH HEAL Initiative's goal is to help advance research that will address the national opioid public health crisis. Opioids are often prescribed for low back pain. They are strong and sometimes addictive painkillers that have been overused and sometimes misused, and not currently indicated for use in chronic low back pain.

To tackle this complex and common problem, teamwork is key, she notes.

What is polio?

Polio, or poliomyelitis, is a disabling and life-threatening disease caused by the poliovirus. The virus can infect a person’s spinal cord, causing paralysis (can’t move parts of the body). Paralysis caused by poliovirus occurs when the virus replicates in and attacks the nervous system. The paralysis can be lifelong, and it can be deadly.

It most often sickens children younger than 5 years old.

What are the symptoms of polio infection?

Most people who get infected with poliovirus do not have any symptoms. Some people (25 people out of 100) will have flu-like symptoms. These symptoms usually last 2 to 5 days.

In rare cases, poliovirus infection can be very serious. About 1 out of 200 people will have weakness or paralysis in their arms, legs, or both. This paralysis or weakness can last a lifetime.

Is it serious?

The risk of lifelong paralysis is very serious. Even children who seem to fully recover can develop new muscle pain, weakness, or paralysis as adults, 15 to 40 years later.

About 2 to 10 children out of 100 who have paralysis from polio die because the virus affects the muscles that help them breathe.

How does polio spread?

Poliovirus is very contagious. It spreads through contact with:

the stool (poop) of an infected person.

droplets from a sneeze or cough of an infected person.

If you get stool or droplets from an infected person on your hands and you touch your mouth, you can get infected. Also, if your child puts objects, like toys, that have stool or droplets on them into their mouth, they can get infected.

An infected person may spread the virus to others immediately before and up to 2 weeks after symptoms appear.

The virus may live in an infected person’s stool for many weeks. He or she can contaminate food and water when they touch it with unwashed hands.

People who don’t have symptoms can still pass the virus to others and make them sick.

Do people still get polio in the United States?

No, thanks to a successful vaccination program, the United States has been polio-free for more than 30 years, but the disease still occurs in other parts of the world. It would only take one person with polio traveling from another country to bring polio back to the United States.",www.cdc.gov

247,Biomarkers Identified in Collegiate Athletes That Could Help Predict Time Needed to Recover From Concussion,"Biomarkers identified in collegiate athletes that could help predict time needed to recover from concussion

What

A collaborative study conducted by scientists from the National Institutes of Health, Department of Defense (DOD), and multiple academic institutions has identified blood biomarkers that could help to predict which athletes need additional time to recover from a sports related concussion. This collaboration, known as the Concussion Assessment, Research, and Education (CARE) consortium, is supported, in part, by DOD and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).

In this study, conducted at several sites across the U.S., 127 male and female collegiate athletes who had sustained a sports-related concussion were tested at several time points: shortly after injury, when their symptoms resolved, and one week after returning to play. Each athlete had also undergone preseason, baseline testing.

Using an ultrasensitive assay that can detect minute amounts of protein, the researchers tested blood serum from these athletes and identified two blood proteins that were associated with the length of time needed by the athletes to return to play. Amounts of these two proteins, tau protein and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were found to be significantly different in athletes who needed less or more than 14 days to return. While further research is needed, the results of this study are an important step towards the development of a test that could help predict which athletes need more time to recover from a concussion and resume activity.

This study was published in JAMA Network Open.

248,"Blood-based Biomarker Can Detect, Predict Severity of Traumatic Brain Injury","Blood-based biomarker can detect, predict severity of traumatic brain injury

NIH Clinical Center

A study from the National Institutes of Health confirms that neurofilament light chain as a blood biomarker can detect brain injury and predict recovery in multiple groups, including professional hockey players with acute or chronic concussions and clinic-based patients with mild, moderate, or severe traumatic brain injury. The research was conducted by scientists at the NIH Clinical Center, Bethesda, Maryland, and published in the July 8, 2020, online issue of Neurology.

After a traumatic brain injury, neurofilament light chain breaks away from neurons in the brain and collects in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The scientists confirmed that neurofilament light chain also collects in the blood in levels that correlate closely with the levels in the CSF. They demonstrated that neurofilament light chain in the blood can detect brain injury and predict recovery across all stages of traumatic brain injury.

“Currently, there are no validated blood-based biomarkers to provide an objective diagnosis of mild traumatic brain injury or to predict recovery,” said Leighton Chan, M.D., M.P.H., chief of the Rehabilitation Medicine Department at the NIH Clinical Center. “Our study reinforces the need and a way forward for a non-invasive test of neurofilament light chain to aid in the diagnosis of patients and athletes whose brain injuries are often unrecognized, undiagnosed or underreported. “

The study examined multiple groups including professional hockey players in Sweden with sports-related concussions, hockey players without concussions, hockey players with persistent post-concussion symptoms, non-athlete controls, and clinic-based patients at the NIH Clinical Center who were healthy or with acute, subacute, and chronic mild traumatic brain injuries. The study showed that neurofilament light chain in the blood:

Correlated closely with CSF neurofilament light chain in hockey players with concussions and non-athlete healthy controls, suggesting that blood neurofilament light chain could be used instead of CSF neurofilament light chain.

Demonstrated strong diagnostic ability for sports-related concussions, where it could identify hockey players with concussions from hockey players without concussions and could identify clinic-based patients with mild, moderate, and severe traumatic brain injuries from each other and controls. This is significant as there is an unmet need for an easy and accessible blood biomarker to determine at the time of injury or in the chronic phase if a person has a concussion or signs of a traumatic brain injury.

Could distinguish with high accuracy hockey players who could return to play after 10 days from those who developed persistent post-concussion symptoms and eventually retired from the game. In the clinic-based cohort, patients with worse functional outcomes had higher blood neurofilament light chain levels. This is significant as there is an unmet need for a blood biomarker that can help clinicians to determine when athletes can safely return to play or when patients can return to work or resume daily activities.

In the clinic-based patients, the levels of blood neurofilament light chain at five years after a single mild, moderate, or severe traumatic brain injury were significantly increased compared to healthy controls. This suggests that even a single mild traumatic brain injury (without visible signs of structural damage on a standard clinical MRI) may cause long-term brain injury, and serum neurofilament light could be a sensitive biomarker to detect even that far out from initial injury.

“This study is the first to do a detailed assessment of serum neurofilament light chain and advanced brain imaging in multiple cohorts, brain injury severities, and time points after injury,” said the study’s lead author, Pashtun Shahim, M.D., Ph.D., NIH Clinical Center. “Our results suggest that serum neurofilament light chain may provide a valuable compliment to imaging by detecting underlying neuronal damage which may be responsible for the long-term symptoms experienced by a significant number of athletes with acute concussions, and patients with more severe brain injuries.”

The study was funded by the Intramural Research Program at NIH, the Department of Defense Center for Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine at the Uniformed Services University, and the Swedish Research Council.

Traumatic brain injury is a major leading cause of death and disability in the United States with more than 2.87 million emergency department visits, hospitalizations and deaths annually. While majority of all traumatic brain injuries are classified as mild (also known as a concussion), it remains difficult to diagnose this condition. There are a wide range of variable behavioral and observational tests to help determine a patient’s injuries but most of these tests rely on the patient to self-report signs and symptoms. Also, imaging has limitations with detecting micro-structural injuries in the brain.

Dr. Chandra Jackson on COVID-19 and Sleep

Video of Coping with COVID-19: Sleep and Health

Excerpts from a conversation between Dr. Marishka Brown at NIH and Dr. Chandra Jackson, an NIH expert on sleep.

Brown: From a sleep perspective, how is the COVID-19 pandemic affecting people?

Jackson: Before the pandemic, at least a third of Americans were not getting the recommended amount of at least seven hours of sleep per day. And before the coronavirus, millions of people suffered from sleep disorders like insomnia.

It’s likely that the stress many of us had before the pandemic has now increased. For instance, if people already felt isolated and depressed, it could be more difficult now to cope. Some may also feel greater financial strain, or job and housing insecurity.

Many new challenges have also emerged. One is being or knowing an essential worker on the front lines, whether a medical doctor, nurse, or a cashier at a grocery store. This can induce anxiety, which we know negatively affects sleep.

Also, our routines have been disrupted. Keeping track of time can be difficult. Other major challenges relate to not being able to cut off work at the end of the workday because you’re at home. Or trying to manage the house with children who are used to being at school and may be getting too much screen time.

All of these factors many of us have been dealing with can cause stress and strain. Those have been shown to negatively affect sleep. Additionally, simply staying in the house versus going outside can greatly lower your exposure to natural light. And lack of natural light can reduce biological signals that are important for sleep at night.

Brown: How does sleep impact the immune systemThe system that protects your body from invading viruses, bacteria, and other microscopic threats.?

Jackson: Good sleep helps support the immune system. Disrupted sleep can reduce circulating cytokines, which are a type of protein that helps protect against infection. This clearly has implications for being able to ward off infectious agents like coronavirus.

And if you’re actually sick for whatever reason, resting your body seems to help you recover faster. Lastly, chronic sleep deprivation has also been shown to make vaccines less effective, by reducing the body’s ability to respond.

Brown: Can you speak to the role of disparities and sleep, and its interplay with COVID-19?

Jackson: Unfavorable sleep is common in the general population to begin with. But individuals who are Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Native American, and even sexual and gender minorities have been shown to be disproportionately burdened by poor sleep. Social stress is generally believed to be the connection across these different but intersecting social identity groups.

In terms of sleep disorders, the most common are obstructive sleep apnea and insomnia. Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, and Asian populations suffer disproportionately from obstructive sleep apnea. A lot of these disparities appear to start early in life. For instance, Black compared to white children have been shown to have a four to six times higher prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing. This is attributed not to genetics, but to living in economically deprived communities with relevant environmental hazards.

So sleep disparities are clearly relevant to the pandemic. They likely contribute to disparities in conditions like diabetes and heart disease. And these are conditions that we know increase susceptibility to poor outcomes related to COVID-19.

Additionally, the mental stress from COVID that we’re all feeling is likely exacerbating existing sleep disparities, because disadvantaged groups are disproportionately affected by the virus for largely social reasons. For instance, racial/ethnic minority groups are more likely to have service-oriented, essential, frontline, and often risky, low wage jobs without worker protections like paid sick leave.

250,Dr. Kenneth Wright on Shift Work and Sleep,"Q&A

Dr. Kenneth Wright on Shift Work and Sleep

Kenneth P. Wright, Jr., PhD, Professor of Distinction, Director, Sleep and Chronobiology Laboratory, University of Colorado Boulder

Excerpts from our conversation with Dr. Kenneth Wright, Jr., an NIH-funded expert on sleep at the University of Colorado, Boulder.

NIHNiH: What is the circadian system? And why is it disrupted by shift work, such as working the night shift?

Wright: The circadian system is our biological clock. That biological clock controls the timing of a lot of our behaviors. These include when you choose to eat and when you choose to be active. For humans, our bodies are programmed to eat food during the daytime, not at nighttime, and be physically active during the daytime and not at nighttime.

For example, look at a hormone called melatonin. Our clock tells the body when to produce melatonin. And high levels of melatonin signal our biological night. Humans are not meant to be eating when melatonin levels are high.

So when we don’t get enough sleep, we are awake when melatonin levels are high. And if we eat during that time, that is associated with impairments in our blood sugar.

That’s one example, but the same goes for any system in our body. We can show that if you don’t get enough sleep, or if your circadian clock is disturbed, that system will be dysregulated in one way or another.

NIHNiH: What kinds of problems can disrupting your circadian clock cause?

Wright: Long-term disruption of circadian patterns can lead to weight gain, to obesity. It can lead to the development of depression or worsening of it. It can lead to type 2 diabetes, it can lead to heart disease and stroke. It can lead to cancer. And when I say lead to, I mean it’s going to impact a lot of those fundamental processes in the body that contribute to these disorders.

NIHNiH: What advice do you give to people who work the night shift or other shifts that could throw off their biological clocks?

Wright: Shift work is a challenge because it really goes against our fundamental biology. But there are specific tips that we can give to people who do shift work.

One of them is to try to maximize your 24-hour total sleep time. What I mean by that is, say after a night shift a worker goes home, is awake for a little bit, and then goes to sleep. They may sleep for five or six hours. And then they wake up, because the clock in their brain tells them it’s time to be awake, not because they got enough sleep.

So what we what recommend is you get that five or six hours. And then you take about a two-hour nap before you go back to work. That will get you closer to that seven or eight hours of recommended sleep.

There’s also a huge population of shift workers that we tend not to focus on. Those are the early morning shift workers, people who start work before 7 am. They’ve got to go to bed earlier than normal, which can induce insomnia. They can try things like taking melatonin to try to go to bed earlier, or exposure to bright lights to try to shift their clock earlier.

Waking up around the same time every day is also important even for shift workers, because it’s a strong signal for our circadian clock. The more irregular you are, if your wake times are bouncing around every day and on the weekends, that’s associated with a lot of health problems.",newsinhealth.nih.gov
251,Good Sleep for Good Health: Get the Rest You Need,"Good Sleep for Good Health

Get the Rest You Need

Sometimes, the pace of modern life barely gives you time to stop and rest. It can make getting a good night’s sleep on a regular basis seem like a dream.

But sleep is as important for good health as diet and exercise. Good sleep improves your brain performance, mood, and health.

Not getting enough quality sleep regularly raises the risk of many diseases and disorders. These range from heart disease and stroke to obesity and dementia.

There’s more to good sleep than just the hours spent in bed, says Dr. Marishka Brown, a sleep expert at NIH. “Healthy sleep encompasses three major things,” she explains. “One is how much sleep you get. Another is sleep quality—that you get uninterrupted and refreshing sleep. The last is a consistent sleep schedule.”

People who work the night shift or irregular schedules may find getting quality sleep extra challenging. And times of great stress—like the current pandemic—can disrupt our normal sleep routines. But there are many things you can do to improve your sleep.

Sleep for Repair

Why do we need to sleep? People often think that sleep is just “down time,” when a tired brain gets to rest, says Dr. Maiken Nedergaard, who studies sleep at the University of Rochester.

“But that’s wrong,” she says. While you sleep, your brain is working. For example, sleep helps prepare your brain to learn, remember, and create.

Nedergaard and her colleagues discovered that the brain has a drainage system that removes toxins during sleep.

“When we sleep, the brain totally changes function,” she explains. “It becomes almost like a kidney, removing waste from the system.”

Her team found in mice that the drainage system removes some of the proteins linked with Alzheimer’s disease. These toxins were removed twice as fast from the brain during sleep.

Everything from blood vessels to the immune systemThe system that protects your body from invading viruses, bacteria, and other microscopic threats. uses sleep as a time for repair, says Dr. Kenneth Wright, Jr., a sleep researcher at the University of Colorado.

“There are certain repair processes that occur in the body mostly, or most effectively, during sleep,” he explains. “If you don’t get enough sleep, those processes are going to be disturbed.”

Sleep Myths and Truths

How much sleep you need changes with age. Experts recommend school-age children get at least nine hours a night and teens get between eight and 10. Most adults need at least seven hours or more of sleep each night.

There are many misunderstandings about sleep. One is that adults need less sleep as they get older. This isn’t true. Older adults still need the same amount. But sleep quality can get worse as you age. Older adults are also more likely to take medications that interfere with sleep.

Another sleep myth is that you can “catch up” on your days off. Researchers are finding that this largely isn’t the case.

“If you have one bad night’s sleep and take a nap, or sleep longer the next night, that can benefit you,” says Wright. “But if you have a week’s worth of getting too little sleep, the weekend isn’t sufficient for you to catch up. That’s not a healthy behavior.”

In a recent study, Wright and his team looked at people with consistently deficient sleep. They compared them to sleep-deprived people who got to sleep in on the weekend.

Both groups of people gained weight with lack of sleep. Their bodies’ ability to control blood sugar levels also got worse. The weekend catch-up sleep didn’t help.

On the flip side, more sleep isn’t always better, says Brown. For adults, “if you’re sleeping more than nine hours a night and you still don’t feel refreshed, there may be some underlying medical issue,” she explains.

Sleep Disorders

Some people have conditions that prevent them from getting enough quality sleep, no matter how hard they try. These problems are called sleep disorders.

The most common sleep disorder is insomnia. “Insomnia is when you have repeated difficulty getting to sleep and/or staying asleep,” says Brown. This happens despite having the time to sleep and a proper sleep environment. It can make you feel tired or unrested during the day.

Insomnia can be short-term, where people struggle to sleep for a few weeks or months. “Quite a few more people have been experiencing this during the pandemic,” Brown says. Long-term insomnia lasts for three months or longer.

Sleep apnea is another common sleep disorder. In sleep apnea, the upper airway becomes blocked during sleep. This reduces or stops airflow, which wakes people up during the night. The condition can be dangerous. If untreated, it may lead to other health problems.

If you regularly have problems sleeping, talk with your health care provider. They may have you keep a sleep diary to track your sleep for several weeks. They can also run tests, including sleep studies. These look for sleep disorders.

Getting Better Sleep

If you’re having trouble sleeping, hearing how important it is may be frustrating. But simple things can improve your odds of a good night’s sleep. See the Wise Choices box for tips to sleep better every day.

Treatments are available for many common sleep disorders. Cognitive behavioral therapy can help many people with insomnia get better sleep. Medications can also help some people.

Many people with sleep apnea benefit from using a device called a CPAP machine. These machines keep the airway open so that you can breathe. Other treatments can include special mouthguards and lifestyle changes.

For everyone, “as best you can, try to make sleep a priority,” Brown says. “Sleep is not a throwaway thing—it’s a biological necessity.”",newsinhealth.nih.gov
252,Catecholamine Tests,"What happens during a catecholamine test?

A catecholamine test may be done in urine or blood. Urine testing is done more often because catecholamine blood levels can change quickly and may also be affected by the stress of testing.

But blood testing can be useful in helping to diagnose a pheochromocytoma tumor. If you have this tumor, certain substances will be released into the bloodstream.

For a catecholamine urine test, your health care provider will ask you to collect all urine during a 24-hour period. This is called a 24-hour urine sample test. For 24-hour urine sample test, your health care provider or a laboratory professional will give you a container to collect your urine and instructions on how to collect and store your samples. Test instructions usually include the following steps:

Empty your bladder in the morning and flush that urine away. Record the time.

For the next 24 hours, save all your urine passed in the container provided.

Store your urine container in the refrigerator or a cooler with ice.

Return the sample container to your health provider's office or the laboratory as instructed.

During a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out.

What is polio?

Polio, or poliomyelitis, is a disabling and life-threatening disease caused by the poliovirus. The virus can infect a person’s spinal cord, causing paralysis (can’t move parts of the body). Paralysis caused by poliovirus occurs when the virus replicates in and attacks the nervous system. The paralysis can be lifelong, and it can be deadly.

It most often sickens children younger than 5 years old.

What are the symptoms of polio infection?

Most people who get infected with poliovirus do not have any symptoms. Some people (25 people out of 100) will have flu-like symptoms. These symptoms usually last 2 to 5 days.

In rare cases, poliovirus infection can be very serious. About 1 out of 200 people will have weakness or paralysis in their arms, legs, or both. This paralysis or weakness can last a lifetime.

Is it serious?

The risk of lifelong paralysis is very serious. Even children who seem to fully recover can develop new muscle pain, weakness, or paralysis as adults, 15 to 40 years later.

About 2 to 10 children out of 100 who have paralysis from polio die because the virus affects the muscles that help them breathe.

How does polio spread?

Poliovirus is very contagious. It spreads through contact with:

the stool (poop) of an infected person.

droplets from a sneeze or cough of an infected person.

If you get stool or droplets from an infected person on your hands and you touch your mouth, you can get infected. Also, if your child puts objects, like toys, that have stool or droplets on them into their mouth, they can get infected.

An infected person may spread the virus to others immediately before and up to 2 weeks after symptoms appear.

The virus may live in an infected person’s stool for many weeks. He or she can contaminate food and water when they touch it with unwashed hands.

People who don’t have symptoms can still pass the virus to others and make them sick.

Do people still get polio in the United States?

No, thanks to a successful vaccination program, the United States has been polio-free for more than 30 years, but the disease still occurs in other parts of the world. It would only take one person with polio traveling from another country to bring polio back to the United States.",www.cdc.gov
254,Pediatric Obstructive Sleep Apnea,"Overview

Pediatric obstructive sleep apnea is a sleep disorder in which your child's breathing is partially or completely blocked repeatedly during sleep. The condition is due to narrowing or blockage of the upper airway during sleep.

There are differences between pediatric obstructive sleep apnea and adult sleep apnea. While adults usually have daytime sleepiness, children are more likely to have behavioral problems. The underlying cause in adults is often obesity, while in children the most common underlying condition is enlargement of the adenoids and tonsils.

Early diagnosis and treatment are important to prevent complications that can affect children's growth, cognitive development and behavior.

Symptoms

During sleep, signs and symptoms of pediatric sleep apnea might include:

Snoring

Pauses in breathing

Restless sleep

Snorting, coughing or choking

Mouth breathing

Nighttime sweating

Bed-wetting

Sleep terrors

Infants and young children with obstructive sleep apnea don't always snore. They might just have disturbed sleep.

During the day, children with sleep apnea might:

Perform poorly in school

Have difficulty paying attention

Have learning problems

Have behavioral problems

Have poor weight gain

Be hyperactive

When to see a doctor

Make an appointment with your child's doctor if your child consistently wakes up in the morning feeling tired and has behavioral problems.

Causes

Obesity is a common factor underlying obstructive sleep apnea in adults. But in children the most common condition leading to obstructive sleep apnea is enlarged tonsils and adenoids. However, obesity also plays a role in children. Other underlying factors can be craniofacial anomalies and neuromuscular disorders.

Risk factors

Besides obesity, other risk factors for pediatric sleep apnea include having:

Down syndrome

Abnormalities in the skull or face

Cerebral palsy

Sickle cell disease

Neuromuscular disease

History of low birth weight

Family history of obstructive sleep apnea

Complications

256,Study of Mosquito Protein Could Lead to Treatments Against Life Threatening Viruses,"Study of mosquito protein could lead to treatments against life-threatening viruses

NIAID

The mosquito protein AEG12 strongly inhibits the family of viruses that cause yellow fever, dengue, West Nile, and Zika and weakly inhibits coronaviruses, according to scientists at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and their collaborators. The researchers found that AEG12 works by destabilizing the viral envelope, breaking its protective covering. Although the protein does not affect viruses that do not have an envelope, such as those that cause pink eye and bladder infections, the findings could lead to therapeutics against viruses that affect millions of people around the world. The research was published online in PNAS.

Scientists at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), part of NIH, used X-ray crystallography to solve the structure of AEG12. Senior author Geoffrey Mueller, Ph.D., head of the NIEHS Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Group, said at the molecular level, AEG12 rips out the lipids, or the fat-like portions of the membrane that hold the virus together.

""It is as if AEG12 is hungry for the lipids that are in the virus membrane, so it gets rid of some of the lipids it has and exchanges them for the ones it really prefers,"" Mueller said. ""The protein has high affinity for viral lipids and steals them from the virus.""

As a result, Mueller says the AEG12 protein has great killing power over some viruses. While the researchers demonstrated that AEG12 was most effective against flaviviruses, the family of viruses to which Zika, West Nile, and others belong, it is possible AEG12 could be effective against SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. But, Mueller said it will take years of bioengineering to make AEG12 a viable therapy for COVID-19. Part of the problem is AEG12 also breaks opens red blood cells, so researchers will have to identify compounds that will make the protein target viruses only.

Alexander Foo, Ph.D., an NIEHS visiting fellow and lead author of the paper, explained that mosquitoes produce AEG12 when they take a blood meal or become infected with flaviviruses. Like humans, mosquitoes mount a vigorous immune response against these viruses, with AEG12 bursting their viral covering. But, at the beginning of the project, Foo and his colleagues knew little about the function of AEG12.

""The prospect of studying a new protein is exciting, yet daunting,"" Foo said. ""Thankfully, we had enough clues and access to a wide range of expertise at NIEHS to piece it together.""

Co-author and crystallography expert Lars Pedersen, Ph.D., is leader of the NIEHS Structure Function Group. He routinely uses information about a molecule’s physical makeup in his work and encourages more scientists to consider using this data in their studies. He said, ""Our research shows that understanding the structure of a protein can be important in figuring out what it does and how it could help treat disease.""

What is hepatitis A?

Hepatitis A is a serious liver disease caused by the hepatitis A virus. Children with the virus often don’t have symptoms, but they often pass the disease to others, including their unvaccinated parents or caregivers. These individuals can get very sick.

What are the symptoms of hepatitis A disease?

Children under 6 years old often have no symptoms. Older children and adults feel

very sick and weak. Symptoms usually appear 2 to 6 weeks after a person gets the virus.

The symptoms may include

Fever

Loss of appetite (not wanting to eat)

Tiredness

Stomach pain

Vomiting

Dark urine

Yellow skin and eyes

Is it serious?

Older children, adolescents and adults often feel sick and symptoms can last for up to 6 months. There is no specific treatment for hepatitis A.

hospital alt solid icon Hepatitis A is a serious disease that used to be more common in the United States. In the 1980s, the United States used to see as many as 30,000 cases a year. Thanks to the vaccine, the number of hepatitis A cases in the United States has dropped by 95%.

How does hepatitis A spread?

Hepatitis A virus is found in the stool (poop) of a person who has the virus. It spreads when a person puts something in his or her mouth that has the hepatitis A virus on it. Even if the item looks clean, it can still have virus on it that can spread to others. The amount of stool can be so tiny that it cannot be seen with the naked eye. You can get it by touching objects such as doorknobs or diapers or eating food that has the virus on it.",www.cdc.gov

There are many reasons why your chloride levels may not be in the normal range. High levels of chloride may indicate:

Dehydration

Kidney disease

Acidosis, a condition in which you have too much acid in your blood. It can cause nausea, vomiting, and fatigue.

Alkalosis, a condition in which you have too much base in your blood. It can cause irritability, muscle twitching, and tingling in the fingers and toes.

Low levels of chloride may indicate:

Heart failure

Lung diseases

Addison's disease, a condition in which your body's adrenal glands don't produce enough of certain types of hormones. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including weakness, dizziness, weight loss, and dehydration.

If your chloride levels are not the normal range, it doesn't necessarily mean you have a medical problem needing treatment. Many factors can affect your chloride levels. If you have taken in too much fluid or have lost fluid because of vomiting or diarrhea, it can affect your chloride levels. Also, certain medicines such as antacids can cause abnormal results.

266,Pregnancy Check-Ups: Healthy Start for Mom and Baby,"Pregnancy Check-Ups

Healthy Start for Mom and Baby

Life is busy before a baby arrives. There are many things to do to prepare. One of the most important is to visit your health care provider regularly.

Check-ups before your baby is born are called prenatal visits. They help make sure you and your baby are healthy. Your health care provider will look for certain problems that can happen during pregnancy. Some issues are best treated early. Others can be prevented before they start.

“Prenatal care is fundamental for shaping the lives of women and their children,” says Dr. Monica Longo, an NIH expert on prenatal health. Longo cares for women with high-risk pregnancies. Such women have a higher chance of complications.

If you think you may be pregnant, schedule a visit with your provider. If you’re pregnant, you’ll need to start regular prenatal visits. Most women have check-ups about once a month in the beginning. Then, they go more often later in the pregnancy.

During a prenatal visit, your provider will ask about your health history. They will also perform a physical exam and weight check. They’ll let you know how much weight gain is healthy for your body and help track your progress.

You’ll also be asked to provide a urine sample. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common during pregnancy. UTIs and other infections increase the risk of having a preterm birth. This is when you give birth at 37 weeks or earlier.

“One of the primary purposes of prenatal care is actually prevention,” says Longo. “We screen women to find potential health problems before those issues can worsen.”

During certain stages of pregnancy, your provider will perform blood tests and imaging tests. These include ultrasound exams to look at the baby’s growth and development. Visits are also an opportunity to talk with your provider about how to give your baby a healthy start.

“During prenatal visits, we educ-ate and counsel moms about healthy habits, healthy food choices, and exercise,” Longo says. “We also address any concerns a new mom-to-be might have.”

Taking a prenatal vitamin is also key. Folic acid is included in most prenatal vitamins. It reduces the risk of severe birth defects that affect the developing brain and spine.

It’s important to stay away from things that could harm your baby. These include certain medications, smoking, and alcoholic drinks. Also, talk with your provider about any health conditions. Conditions like diabetes (a disease that causes high blood sugar) and high blood pressure need to be brought under control.

Some women choose to talk with their provider before becoming pregnant. This is called a preconception visit. It can help you plan for a safer pregnancy.

Early and regular care for you and your developing baby is important. Studies show that prenatal care reduces the risk of having a low-birth weight baby. Low birth weight can cause health problems. Even during the pandemic, it’s essential to keep up with regular prenatal care.

“Providers around the globe have adapted prenatal care to fit the current challenges,” says Longo. That means using telehealth for visits that don’t have to be done in person.

Health care providers are also seeing fewer patients and extending the time between them. This reduces possible exposure in waiting rooms.

“Providers are prepared for these difficult times,” says Longo. So it’s crucial that moms-to-be keep up with prenatal care.",newsinhealth.nih.gov

274,Vaccine Safety: MedlinePlus Health Topic,"Summary

What are vaccines?

Vaccines play an important role in keeping us healthy. They protect us from serious and sometimes deadly diseases. Vaccines are injections (shots), liquids, pills, or nasal sprays that you take to teach your body's immune system to recognize and defend against harmful germs. The germs could be viruses or bacteria.

Some types of vaccines contain germs that cause disease. But the germs have been killed or weakened enough that they won't make you sick. Some vaccines only contain a part of a germ. Other types of vaccines include instructions for your cells to make a protein of the germ.

These different vaccine types all spark an immune response, which helps your body fight off the germs. Your immune system will also remember the germ and attack it if that germ ever invades again. This protection against a certain disease is called immunity.

These diseases can be very serious. Because of this, getting immunity from a vaccine is safer than getting immunity by being sick with the disease. And for a few vaccines, getting vaccinated can actually give you a better immune response than getting the disease would.

Do vaccines cause side effects?

As with medicines, any vaccine can cause side effects. Most of the time the side effects are minor, such as a sore arm, fatigue, or mild fever. They usually go away within a few days. These common side effects are often a sign that your body is starting to build immunity against a disease.

Serious side effects from vaccines can happen, but they are very rare. These side effects could include a severe allergic reaction. Other possible side effects are different for each vaccine. Talk with your health care provider if you're concerned about your health after getting vaccinated.

Some people worry that childhood vaccines could cause autism spectrum disorder (ASD). But many scientific studies have looked at this and have found no link between vaccines and ASD.

How are vaccines tested for safety?

Every vaccine that is approved in the United States goes through extensive safety testing. It starts with testing and evaluation of the vaccine before it's approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This process can often take several years.

First, the vaccine is tested in labs. Based on those tests, the FDA decides whether to test the vaccine with people.

Testing with people is done through clinical trials. In these trials, the vaccines are tested on volunteers. Clinical trials usually start with 20 to 100 volunteers, but eventually include thousands of volunteers.

The clinical trials have three phases. The trials are looking for the answer to important questions such as Is the vaccine safe? What dose (amount) works best? How does the immune system react to it? How effective is it?

During the process, the FDA works closely with the company who makes the vaccine to evaluate the vaccine's safety and effectiveness. If the vaccine is found to be safe and effective, it will be approved and licensed by the FDA.

After a vaccine is licensed, experts may consider adding it to the recommended vaccine, or immunization, schedule. This schedule is from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It lists which vaccines are recommended for different groups of people. They list which age groups should get which vaccines, how many doses they need, and when they should get them.

Testing and monitoring continue after the vaccine is approved:

The company making the vaccines tests every batch of vaccines for quality and safety. The FDA reviews the results of these tests. It also inspects the factories where the vaccine is made. These checks help make sure the vaccines meet standards for quality and safety.

The FDA, CDC, and other federal agencies continue to monitor its safety, to watch for possible side effects. They have systems to track any safety issues with the vaccines.

These high safety standards and testing help to make sure that vaccines in the United States are safe. Vaccines help protect against serious, even deadly, diseases. They not only protect you, but also help to keep these diseases from spreading to others.",medlineplus.gov
275,Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS),"Important: If you are experiencing a medical emergency, seek immediate assistance from a healthcare provider or call 9-1-1. CDC and FDA do not provide individual medical treatment, advice, or diagnosis. If you need individual medical or health care advice, consult a qualified healthcare provider.",vaers.hhs.gov
276,FDA and CDC Lift Recommended Pause on Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) COVID-19 Vaccine Use Following Thorough Safety Review,"Following a thorough safety review, including two meetings of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have determined that the recommended pause regarding the use of the Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) COVID-19 Vaccine in the U.S. should be lifted and use of the vaccine should resume.

The pause was recommended after reports of six cases of a rare and severe type of blood clot in individuals following administration of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. During the pause, medical and scientific teams at the FDA and CDC examined available data to assess the risk of thrombosis involving the cerebral venous sinuses, or CVST (large blood vessels in the brain), and other sites in the body (including but not limited to the large blood vessels of the abdomen and the veins of the legs) along with thrombocytopenia, or low blood platelet counts. The teams at FDA and CDC also conducted extensive outreach to providers and clinicians to ensure they were made aware of the potential for these adverse events and could properly manage and recognize these events due to the unique treatment required for these blood clots and low platelets, also known as thrombosis-thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS).

The two agencies have determined the following:

Use of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine should be resumed in the United States.

The FDA and CDC have confidence that this vaccine is safe and effective in preventing COVID-19.

The FDA has determined that the available data show that the vaccine’s known and potential benefits outweigh its known and potential risks in individuals 18 years of age and older.

At this time, the available data suggest that the chance of TTS occurring is very low, but the FDA and CDC will remain vigilant in continuing to investigate this risk.

Health care providers administering the vaccine and vaccine recipients or caregivers should review the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers Administering Vaccine (Vaccination Providers) external icon and Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers external icon , which have been revised to include information about the risk of this syndrome, which has occurred in a very small number of people who have received the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine.

CDC’s independent Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices met today to discuss the latest data on TTS, hearing from the vaccine manufacturer Janssen and the COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Technical (VaST) Subgroup, as well as a risk benefit analysis. ACIP is committed to be vigilant and responsive to additional information that could impact the risk benefit analysis of any of these vaccines. Vaccine safety monitoring will continue and any new information about TTS will be brought to ACIP as needed.

“Safety is our top priority. This pause was an example of our extensive safety monitoring working as they were designed to work—identifying even these small number of cases. We’ve lifted the pause based on the FDA and CDC’s review of all available data and in consultation with medical experts and based on recommendations from the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. We have concluded that the known and potential benefits of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine outweigh its known and potential risks in individuals 18 years of age and older. We are confident that this vaccine continues to meet our standards for safety, effectiveness and quality. We recommend people with questions about which vaccine is right for them have those discussions with their health care provider,” said Janet Woodcock, M.D., Acting FDA Commissioner.

“Above all else, health and safety are at the forefront of our decisions,” said CDC Director Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky. “Our vaccine safety systems are working. We identified exceptionally rare events – out of millions of doses of the Janssen COVID-19 administered – and we paused to examine them more carefully. As we always do, we will continue to watch all signals closely as more Americans are vaccinated. I continue to be encouraged by the growing body of real-world evidence that the authorized COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective, and they protect people from disease, hospitalization, and death. I urge anyone with questions about the COVID-19 vaccines to speak with their healthcare provider or local public health department.”

Assessment of Available Data

Medical and scientific teams at the FDA and CDC reviewed several sources of information and data related to the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine to reach today’s decision.

Specifically, the agencies assessed reports submitted to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS),external icon reviewed the medical literature and considered the information from global regulatory partners about thrombosis with thrombocytopenia that have been reported following use of a similar, yet not identical, COVID-19 vaccine using a virus from the adenovirus family that has been modified to contain the gene for making a protein from SARS-CoV-2.

Update on Adverse Events

On April 13, the FDA and CDC announcedexternal icon that, out of more than 6.8 million doses administered, six reports of a rare and severe type of blood clot combined with low blood platelet levels occurring in people after receiving the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine had been reported to VAERS. In these cases, a type of blood clot called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) was seen in combination with low levels of blood platelets (thrombocytopenia).

Today, the agencies can confirm that a total of 15 cases of TTS have been reported to VAERS, including the original six reported cases. All of these cases occurred in women between the ages of 18 and 59, with a median age of 37 years. Reports indicated symptom onset between 6 and 15 days after vaccination.

Monitoring for Safety Will Continue

The surveillance systems that are in place to monitor the safety of COVID-19 vaccines authorized for emergency use are working, as demonstrated by both agencies’ quick work to identify and investigate these rare, but serious adverse events. The FDA and CDC will continue with these efforts to closely monitor the safety of these vaccines.

277,Recommendation to Pause Use of Johnson & Johnson's Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine,"Since use of COVID-19 vaccines began in the United States, scientists and doctors have constantly and carefully reviewed all reports of vaccine side effects and adverse events. As of April 23, 2021, more than 8 million doses of the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine had been given in the United States. As of April 23, 2021, experts reviewing safety reports for this vaccine found 15 reports of women who got the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine and later developed thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). TTS is a serious condition that involves blood clots with low platelets.

These reports suggest an increased risk of TTS one to two weeks after vaccination with the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. As of April 23, 2021, the reports reviewed all occurred in women between 18 and 59 years old, with a median of 37 years. These reports represent a reporting rate of 7 such events per 1 million vaccinations among women 18 through 49 years old and a rate of 0.9 per 1 million vaccinations among women 50 years and older.

278,What Are mRNA Vaccines and How Do They Work?,"Vaccines help prepare the body to fight foreign invaders (pathogens such as bacteria or viruses), to prevent infection. All vaccines introduce into the body a harmless piece of a particular bacteria or virus, triggering an immune response. Most vaccines contain a weakened or killed bacteria or virus. However, scientists have developed a new type of vaccine that uses a molecule called messenger RNA (or mRNA for short) rather than part of an actual bacteria or virus. Messenger RNA is a type of RNA that is necessary for protein production. In cells, mRNA uses the information in genes to create a blueprint for making proteins. Once cells finish making a protein, they quickly break down the mRNA. mRNA from vaccines does not enter the nucleus and does not alter DNA.

mRNA vaccines work by introducing a piece of mRNA that corresponds to a viral protein, usually a small piece of a protein found on the virus’s outer membrane. (Individuals who get an mRNA vaccine are not exposed to the virus, nor can they become infected by it.) Using this mRNA blueprint, cells produce the viral protein. As part of a normal immune response, the immune system recognizes that the protein is foreign and produces specialized proteins called antibodies. Antibodies help protect the body against infection by recognizing individual viruses or other pathogens, attaching to them, and marking the pathogens for destruction. Once produced, antibodies remain in the body, even after the body has rid itself of the pathogen, so that the immune system can quickly respond if exposed again. If a person is exposed to a virus after receiving mRNA vaccination for it, antibodies can quickly recognize it, attach to it, and mark it for destruction before it can cause serious illness.

Like all vaccines in the United States, mRNA vaccines require authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before they can be used. Currently vaccines for COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, are the only authorized mRNA vaccines. These vaccines use mRNA that directs cells to produce copies of a protein on the outside of the coronavirus known as the “spike protein”. Researchers are studying how mRNA might be used to develop vaccines for additional infectious diseases.",medlineplus.gov

Español 中文 한국의 Tagalog Tiếng Việt

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized three COVID-19 vaccines for emergency use. The vaccines are:

Emergency use authorization (EUA) allows these vaccines to be distributed in the U.S. Learn more about EUAs for COVID-19 vaccines from the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER).

Who authorizes COVID-19 vaccines for emergency use?

The FDA is the authority that has regulatory oversight of the safety, effectiveness and quality of vaccines that are used in the U.S., including COVID-19 vaccines. FDA employees who are career scientists and doctors are the people who decided to authorize COVID-19 vaccines after they thoroughly analyzed and evaluated the data on COVID-19 vaccine safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality.

The FDA may issue an EUA when the agency’s scientific experts have determined that the known and potential benefits of the vaccine outweigh its known and potential risks. FDA employees are fathers, mothers, daughters, sons, sisters, brothers and more. They and their families are directly impacted by the work they do.

Why should I get a COVID-19 vaccine?

When you get a COVID-19 vaccine, you are choosing to protect yourself and make a difference for your children, parents, grandparents, and other loved ones. Millions of people in the U.S. have already received a COVID-19 vaccine. For a community to be fully protected, most community members need to get the vaccine. Getting vaccinated to prevent COVID-19 will help protect you from COVID-19, and it may also protect the people around you.

How do I get a COVID-19 vaccine?

Go to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website to find your state and local health departments who are responsible for COVID-19 vaccine distribution. All questions and concerns should be sent to your state government or local health department. The U.S. government’s goal is to have enough COVID-19 vaccine doses for all people in the U.S. who choose to be vaccinated.

FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines are being distributed for free by states and local communities. If you see vaccines for sale online, or if someone asks you for money to get a vaccine appointment, to put your name on a waiting list, or to get access to a vaccine, it is a scam. You do not need to pay to get a vaccine appointment or to be put on a waiting list.

Do the COVID-19 vaccines work?

Yes. All three FDA-authorized vaccines are effective in preventing COVID-19 and related serious outcomes, including hospitalization and deaths. The FDA thoroughly evaluated and analyzed the safety and effectiveness data for all of the authorized COVID-19 vaccines and determined that the available data for each vaccine provides clear evidence that the known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks of each vaccine.

Do the COVID-19 vaccines work against the new variants?

The available information suggests that the authorized vaccines remain effective in protecting the American public against currently circulating strains of COVID-19. We are already talking with vaccine manufacturers about these new strains and how to quickly and safely make any changes that may be needed in the future.

Some variants spread more easily than others and are more transmissible than the original virus that causes COVID-19. To help slow the spread of COVID-19, get a COVID-19 vaccine when it is available to you. Other ways to slow the spread include:

Wearing a mask

Keeping 6 feet apart from others who don’t live with you

Avoiding crowds and poorly ventilated indoor spaces

Washing your hands often with soap and water (use hand sanitizer if soap and water aren’t available)

How safe are the COVID-19 vaccines?

The FDA evaluated data from clinical studies that included tens of thousands of people for each COVID-19 vaccine. The FDA authorized the vaccines because the data from these studies clearly showed that the known and potential benefits of the FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines outweighed the known and potential risks.



Report vaccine side effects toll-free at 1-800-822-7967 or online to FDA/CDC Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).

Millions of doses of FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines have been given to people all around the country. Serious adverse events following vaccination are very rare. Allergic reactions, some of which are severe, and cases of anaphylaxis have occurred following administration of COVID-19 vaccines. Anaphylaxis is a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction that happens within seconds or minutes of exposure to an allergen. Because of this remote chance of severe allergic reaction or anaphylaxis, health care providers may ask you to stay at the place where you received your COVID-19 vaccine for monitoring for 15 to 30 minutes.

For one vaccine, the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine, there have been cases reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) of a type of blood clot called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) in combination with low levels of platelets in the blood (thrombocytopenia). CVST occurs when a blood clot forms in the brain's venous sinuses. This prevents blood from draining out of the brain. It is a type of rare stroke.

On April 13, 2021, the FDA and CDC recommended a pause in the use of this vaccine out of an abundance of caution while it further investigates these cases and to ensure that the health care provider community is aware of the potential for these adverse events and can plan for proper recognition and management due to the unique treatment required with this type of blood clot.

Can I see the safety and effectiveness data that support the Emergency Use Authorization of the COVID-19 vaccines?

The FDA is publicly sharing information about COVID-19 vaccines so you can see the evidence for yourself. The FDA’s analysis of clinical trial data, as well as demographic information about the clinical study volunteers, is available in the FDA Briefing Document for each vaccine. You can also view the advisory committee webcasts where outside experts discuss the data. The FDA’s reasoning for authorizing each vaccine is available in the FDA Decision Memorandum.

Does the FDA monitor COVID-19 vaccine safety after authorization?

Yes. The FDA and the CDC have several systems in place to continually monitor COVID-19 vaccine safety. These systems, called “passive surveillance” and “active surveillance” systems, rapidly detect and investigate potential safety problems. Systems such as the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and CDC’s text-based v-safe system, which receive reports of adverse events following vaccination, are examples of passive surveillance systems. The FDA‘s BEST Initiative is an example of an active surveillance system, which can rapidly analyze information occurring in millions of individuals recorded in large data systems to investigate any safety signals that are identified by VAERS or v-safe.

Why are the FDA and CDC recommending a pause in the use of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine?

The FDA and CDC are reviewing data involving six cases reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) of a low level of platelets in the blood in combination with a rare and severe type of blood clot called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) in individuals who had received the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. One individual died. All cases occurred in females ranging in age from 18 through 48 years. In some of the reported cases of CVST, blood clots also involved large veins in the abdomen. Out of an abundance of caution, the FDA and CDC are recommending a pause in the use of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine while the FDA and CDC, including through its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices investigate these reports of serious adverse events. This is important, in part, to help ensure that health care providers are aware of the potential for these adverse events and can plan for proper recognition and management due to the unique treatment required for CVST with low levels of platelets. The safety monitoring program that is in place to monitor COVID-19 vaccines is working, as we were able to detect the reports of these very rare, serious adverse events early and take action to assess them. The FDA and CDC will continue to fully investigate all reports to determine if a causal relationship exists.

If I received the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine, am I at risk for these adverse events?

If you received the vaccine a month or more ago, the risk of these events appears to be extremely low. In all six cases, the symptoms occurred 6 to 13 days after vaccination. You should contact your health care provider immediately if you are experiencing any of the following symptoms:

These symptoms are distinct from the commonly reported side effects that people may experience in the first few days following vaccination, which can include headache, fatigue, muscle aches and nausea. Most of these side effects are mild to moderate in severity and last 1-2 days.

shortness of breath

chest pain

leg swelling

persistent abdominal pain

neurological symptoms (including severe or persistent headaches or blurred vision)

a diffuse rash on the skin consisting of pinpoint like spots (petechiae)

What should health care providers look for in evaluating Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine recipients for these rare events?

Healthcare providers should be alert to the signs and symptoms of thromboembolism and/or thrombocytopenia in individuals vaccinated with Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. In the management of cases of thromboembolism with thrombocytopenia following Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine, heparin and its derivatives should be avoided, and health care providers should consider consulting a hematologist.

Pregnant people are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19

Although the overall risk of severe illness is low, pregnant people are at an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 when compared with non-pregnant people. Severe illness includes illness that requires hospitalization, intensive care, or a ventilator or special equipment to breathe, or illness that results in death. Additionally, pregnant people with COVID-19 might be at increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth, compared with pregnant women without COVID-19.

Limited data are available about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines for people who are pregnant

Based on how these vaccines work in the body, experts believe they are unlikely to pose a risk for people who are pregnant. However, there are currently limited data on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnant people.

Clinical trials that study the safety of COVID-19 vaccines and how well they work in pregnant people are underway or planned. Vaccine manufacturers are also collecting and reviewing data from people in the completed clinical trials who received vaccine and became pregnant.

Studies in animals receiving a Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, or J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine before or during pregnancy found no safety concerns in pregnant animals or their babies.

CDC and the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) have safety monitoring systems in place to gather information about COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy and will closely monitor that information. Early dataexternal icon from these systems are preliminary, but reassuring. These data did not identify any safety concerns for pregnant people who were vaccinated or for their babies. Most of the pregnancies reported in these systems are ongoing, so more follow-up data are needed for people vaccinated just before or early in pregnancy. We will continue to follow people vaccinated during all trimesters of pregnancy to understand effects on pregnancy and babies.

The Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines are mRNA vaccines that do not contain the live virus that causes COVID-19 and therefore, cannot give someone COVID-19. Additionally, mRNA vaccines do not interact with a person’s DNA or cause genetic changes because the mRNA does not enter the nucleus of the cell, which is where our DNA is kept. Learn more about how COVID-19 mRNA vaccines work.

The J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine is a viral vector vaccine, meaning it uses a modified version of a different virus (the vector) to deliver important instructions to our cells. Vaccines that use the same viral vector have been given to pregnant people in all trimesters of pregnancy, including in a large-scale Ebola vaccination trial. No adverse pregnancy-related outcomes, including adverse outcomes that affected the infant, were associated with vaccination in these trials.

290,Vaccine Safety: MedlinePlus Health Topic,"Summary

What are vaccines?

Vaccines play an important role in keeping us healthy. They protect us from serious and sometimes deadly diseases. Vaccines are injections (shots), liquids, pills, or nasal sprays that you take to teach your body's immune system to recognize and defend against harmful germs. The germs could be viruses or bacteria.

Some types of vaccines contain germs that cause disease. But the germs have been killed or weakened enough that they won't make you sick. Some vaccines only contain a part of a germ. Other types of vaccines include instructions for your cells to make a protein of the germ.

These different vaccine types all spark an immune response, which helps your body fight off the germs. Your immune system will also remember the germ and attack it if that germ ever invades again. This protection against a certain disease is called immunity.

These diseases can be very serious. Because of this, getting immunity from a vaccine is safer than getting immunity by being sick with the disease. And for a few vaccines, getting vaccinated can actually give you a better immune response than getting the disease would.

Do vaccines cause side effects?

As with medicines, any vaccine can cause side effects. Most of the time the side effects are minor, such as a sore arm, fatigue, or mild fever. They usually go away within a few days. These common side effects are often a sign that your body is starting to build immunity against a disease.

Serious side effects from vaccines can happen, but they are very rare. These side effects could include a severe allergic reaction. Other possible side effects are different for each vaccine. Talk with your health care provider if you're concerned about your health after getting vaccinated.

Some people worry that childhood vaccines could cause autism spectrum disorder (ASD). But many scientific studies have looked at this and have found no link between vaccines and ASD.

How are vaccines tested for safety?

Every vaccine that is approved in the United States goes through extensive safety testing. It starts with testing and evaluation of the vaccine before it's approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This process can often take several years.

First, the vaccine is tested in labs. Based on those tests, the FDA decides whether to test the vaccine with people.

Testing with people is done through clinical trials. In these trials, the vaccines are tested on volunteers. Clinical trials usually start with 20 to 100 volunteers, but eventually include thousands of volunteers.

The clinical trials have three phases. The trials are looking for the answer to important questions such as Is the vaccine safe? What dose (amount) works best? How does the immune system react to it? How effective is it?

During the process, the FDA works closely with the company who makes the vaccine to evaluate the vaccine's safety and effectiveness. If the vaccine is found to be safe and effective, it will be approved and licensed by the FDA.

After a vaccine is licensed, experts may consider adding it to the recommended vaccine, or immunization, schedule. This schedule is from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It lists which vaccines are recommended for different groups of people. They list which age groups should get which vaccines, how many doses they need, and when they should get them.

Testing and monitoring continue after the vaccine is approved:

The company making the vaccines tests every batch of vaccines for quality and safety. The FDA reviews the results of these tests. It also inspects the factories where the vaccine is made. These checks help make sure the vaccines meet standards for quality and safety.

The FDA, CDC, and other federal agencies continue to monitor its safety, to watch for possible side effects. They have systems to track any safety issues with the vaccines.

These high safety standards and testing help to make sure that vaccines in the United States are safe. Vaccines help protect against serious, even deadly, diseases. They not only protect you, but also help to keep these diseases from spreading to others.",medlineplus.gov

292,Vaccine (Shot) for Whooping Cough (Pertussis),"What are the symptoms of whooping cough?

Whooping cough usually starts with the following symptoms:

Runny nose

Mild cough

A pause in breathing in babies (apnea)

Children and babies may then begin to develop these more serious problems:

Coughing very hard, over and over. These coughing fits happen more at night.

Gasping for breath after a coughing fit. They may make a “whooping” sound. This sound is where the name “whooping cough” comes from. Babies may not cough or make this sound—they may gag, gasp, or stop breathing.

Difficulty breathing, eating, drinking, or sleeping.

Turning blue from lack of oxygen.

Vomiting after coughing fits.

Coughing fits can last for up to 10 weeks or more, and sometimes happen again the next time the child has a respiratory illness.

Is it serious?

Whooping cough is most dangerous for babies and young children. In fact, babies younger than 1 year old who have whooping cough may:

Need to be cared for in the hospital

Develop pneumonia (a serious lung infection)

Have seizures

Suffer brain damage

Women can get Tdap during pregnancy to pass whooping cough protection to their babies. This helps protect babies until they can start getting their own whooping cough shots. Learn more…

Whooping cough can even be deadly. About 7 in 10 deaths from whooping cough are among babies younger than 2 months old. These babies are too young to get whooping cough shots.

How does whooping cough spread?

Whooping cough spreads easily through the air when a person who has whooping cough breathes, coughs, or sneezes. Almost everyone who is not immune to whooping cough will get sick if exposed to it. A person can spread the disease from the very beginning of the sickness (when he has cold-like symptoms) and for at least 2 weeks after coughing starts.

Since symptoms can be mild for some people, your baby can catch whooping cough from adults, grandparents, or older brothers or sisters who don’t know they have the disease.

Do people still get whooping cough in the United States?

Before the whooping cough vaccines were recommended for all infants, about 8,000 people in the United States died each year from whooping cough. Today, because of the vaccine, this number has dropped to fewer than 20 per year.

But, cases of whooping cough have been increasing over the past several years, and outbreaks of whooping cough can occur.",www.cdc.gov

Español Português 中文 Tagalog Tiếng Việt 한국어

COVID-19. We’ve been living with it for what sometimes seems like forever. Given the number of deaths that have occurred from the disease, it’s perhaps not surprising that some consumers are looking at unconventional treatments, not approved or authorized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Though this is understandable, please beware. The FDA’s job is to carefully evaluate the scientific data on a drug to be sure that it is both safe and effective for a particular use, and then to decide whether or not to approve it. Using any treatment for COVID-19 that’s not approved or authorized by the FDA, unless part of a clinical trial, can cause serious harm.

There seems to be a growing interest in a drug called ivermectin to treat humans with COVID-19. Ivermectin is often used in the U.S. to treat or prevent parasites in animals. The FDA has received multiple reports of patients who have required medical support and been hospitalized after self-medicating with ivermectin intended for horses.

Here’s What You Need to Know about Ivermectin

FDA has not approved ivermectin for use in treating or preventing COVID-19 in humans. Ivermectin tablets are approved at very specific doses for some parasitic worms, and there are topical (on the skin) formulations for head lice and skin conditions like rosacea. Ivermectin is not an anti-viral (a drug for treating viruses).

Taking large doses of this drug is dangerous and can cause serious harm.

If you have a prescription for ivermectin for an FDA-approved use, get it from a legitimate source and take it exactly as prescribed.

Never use medications intended for animals on yourself. Ivermectin preparations for animals are very different from those approved for humans.

What is Ivermectin and How is it Used?

Ivermectin tablets are approved by the FDA to treat people with intestinal strongyloidiasis and onchocerciasis, two conditions caused by parasitic worms. In addition, some topical (on the skin) forms of ivermectin are approved to treat external parasites like head lice and for skin conditions such as rosacea.

Some forms of ivermectin are used in animals to prevent heartworm disease and certain internal and external parasites. It’s important to note that these products are different from the ones for people, and safe when used as prescribed for animals, only.

When Can Taking Ivermectin Be Unsafe?

The FDA has not reviewed data to support use of ivermectin in COVID-19 patients to treat or to prevent COVID-19; however, some initial research is underway. Taking a drug for an unapproved use can be very dangerous. This is true of ivermectin, too.

There’s a lot of misinformation around, and you may have heard that it’s okay to take large doses of ivermectin. That is wrong.

Even the levels of ivermectin for approved uses can interact with other medications, like blood-thinners. You can also overdose on ivermectin, which can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hypotension (low blood pressure), allergic reactions (itching and hives), dizziness, ataxia (problems with balance), seizures, coma and even death.

Ivermectin Products for Animals Are Different from Ivermectin Products for People

For one thing, animal drugs are often highly concentrated because they are used for large animals like horses and cows, which can weigh a lot more than we do—a ton or more. Such high doses can be highly toxic in humans.

Moreover, FDA reviews drugs not just for safety and effectiveness of the active ingredients, but also for the inactive ingredients. Many inactive ingredients found in animal products aren’t evaluated for use in people. Or they are included in much greater quantity than those used in people. In some cases, we don’t know how those inactive ingredients will affect how ivermectin is absorbed in the human body.

Meanwhile, effective ways to limit the spread of COVID-19 continue to be to wear your mask, stay at least 6 feet from others who don’t live with you, wash hands frequently, and avoid crowds.

306,Antibodies Protect Against COVID-19 Reinfection,"Health Capsule

Antibodies Protect Against COVID-19 Reinfection

NIAID

After having COVID-19, most people’s bodies develop antibodies to help fight it off. These are special molecules made by the body’s disease defense system, the immune system. A study found that people with these antibodies were less likely to get COVID-19 again.

Researchers looked at more than 3 million people who had an antibody test for SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes COVID-19.

They found that about 11% of people had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. More than 88% had a negative test. And less than 1% of tests were inconclusive.

The scientists looked at who came down with COVID-19 after the test. They analyzed up to 30 days, 31–60 days, 61–90 days, and more than 90 days after.

About 3% to 4% of people with negative antibody tests got COVID-19 in each time period. But those who had antibodies were less likely to have COVID-19 as time went on. Only 0.3% of the people with antibodies had a positive COVID-19 test more than 90 days after. Those without antibodies were 10 times more likely to get the disease.

The findings suggest that people who have a positive result from an antibody test may be at lower risk for future infection with SARS-CoV-2.

NIH’s Dr. Lynn Penberthy, who led the research team, explains that more questions still need to be answered. “We are nevertheless encouraged by this early finding,” she says.",newsinhealth.nih.gov

308,Coronavirus and the Nervous System,"What is COVID-19?

Coronaviruses are common causes of usually mild to moderate upper respiratory tract illnesses like the common cold, with symptoms that may include runny nose, fever, sore throat, cough, or a general feeling of being ill. However, a new coronavirus called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged and spread to cause the COVID-19 pandemic.

COVID-19, which means Coronavirus disease 2019, is an infectious disease that can affect people of all ages in many ways. It is most dangerous when the virus spreads from the upper respiratory tract into the lungs to cause viral pneumonia and lung damage leading to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). When severe, this impairs the body’s ability to maintain critical levels of oxygen in the blood stream—which can cause multiple body systems to fail and can be fatal.

top

What do we know about the effects of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 on the nervous system?

Much of the research to date has focused on the acute infection and saving lives. These strategies have included preventing infection with vaccines, treating COVID-19 symptoms with medicines or antibodies, and reducing complications in infected individuals.

Research shows the many neurological symptoms of COVID-19 are likely a result of the body’s widespread immune response to infection rather than the virus directly infecting the brain or nervous system. In some people, the SARS-CoV-2 infection causes an overreactive response of the immune system which can also damage body systems. Changes in the immune system have been seen in studies of the cerebrospinal fluid, which bathes the brain, in people who have been infected by SARS-CoV-2. This includes the presence of antibodies—proteins made by the immune system to fight the virus—that may also react with the nervous system. Although still under intense investigation, there is no evidence of widespread viral infection in the brain. Scientists are still learning how the virus affects the brain and other organs in the long-term. Research is just beginning to focus on the role of autoimmune reactions and other changes that cause the set of symptoms that some people experience after their initial recovery. It is unknown if injury to the nervous system or other body organs cause lingering effects that will resolve over time, or whether COVID-19 infection sets up a more persistent or even chronic disorder.

What are the immediate (acute) effects of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 on the brain?

Most people infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus will have no or mild to moderate symptoms associated with the brain or nervous system. However, most hospitalized patients do have symptoms related to the brain or nervous system, most commonly including muscle aches, headaches, dizziness, and altered taste and smell. Some people with COVID-19 either initially have, or develop in the hospital, a dramatic state of confusion called delirium. Although rare, COVID-19 can cause seizures or major strokes. Muscular weakness, nerve injury, and pain syndromes are common in people who require intensive care during infections. There are also very rare reports of conditions that develop after SARS-CoV-2 infection, as they sometimes do with other types of infections. These disorders of inflammation in the nervous system include Guillain-Barré syndrome (which affects nerves), transverse myelitis (which affects the spinal cord), and acute necrotizing leukoencephalopathy (which affects the brain).

Bleeding in the brain, weakened blood vessels, and blood clots in acute infection

The SARS-CoV-2 virus attaches to a specific molecule (called a receptor) on the surface of cells in the body. This molecule is concentrated in the lung cells but is also present on certain cells that line blood vessels in the body. The infection causes some arteries and veins – including those in the brain – to become thin, weaken, and leak. Breaks in small blood vessels have caused bleeding in the brain (so-called microbleeds) in some people with COVID-19 infection. Studies in people who have died due to COVID-19 infection show leaky blood vessels in different areas of the brain that allow water and a host of other molecules as well as blood cells that are normally excluded from the brain to move from the blood stream into the brain. This leak, as well as the resulting inflammation around blood vessels, can cause multiple small areas of damage. COVID-19 also causes blood cells to clump and form clots in arteries and veins throughout the body. These blockages reduce or block the flow of blood, oxygen, and nutrients that cells need to function and can lead to a stroke or heart attack.

A stroke is a sudden interruption of continuous blood flow to the brain. A stroke occurs either when a blood vessel in the brain becomes blocked or narrowed or when a blood vessel bursts and spills blood into the brain. Strokes can damage brain cells and cause permanent disability. The blood clots and vascular (relating to the veins, capillaries, and arteries in the body) damage from COVID-19 can cause strokes even in young healthy adults who do not have the common risk factors for stroke.

COVID-19 can cause blood clots in other parts of the body, too. A blood clot in or near the heart can cause a heart attack. A heart attack or Inflammation in the heart, called myocarditis, can cause heart failure, and reduce the flow of blood to other parts of the body. A blood clot in the lungs can impair breathing and cause pain. Blood clots also can damage the kidneys and other organs.

Low levels of oxygen in the body (called hypoxia) can permanently damage the brain and other vital organs in the body. Some hospitalized individuals require artificial ventilation on respirators. To avoid chest movements that oppose use of the ventilator it may be necessary to temporarily “paralyze” the patient and use anesthetic drugs to put the individual to sleep. Some individuals with severe hypoxia require artificial means of bringing oxygen into their blood stream, a technique called extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Hypoxia combined with these intensive care unit measure generally cause cognitive disorders that show slow recovery.

Diagnostic imaging of some people who have had COVID-19 show changes in the brain’s white matter that contains the long nerve fibers, or “wires,” over which information flows from one brain region to another. These changes may be due to a lack of oxygen in the brain, the inflammatory immune system response to the virus, injury to blood vessels, or leaky blood vessels. This “diffuse white matter disease” might contribute to cognitive difficulties in people with COVID-19. Diffuse white matter disease is not uncommon in individuals requiring intensive hospital care but it not clear if it also occurs in those with mild to moderate severity of COVID-19 illness.

What is the typical recovery from COVID-19?

Fortunately, people who have mild to moderate symptoms typically recover in a few days or weeks. However, some people who have had only mild or moderate symptoms of COVID-19 continue to experience dysfunction of body systems—particularly in the lungs but also possibly affecting the liver, kidneys, heart, skin, and brain and nervous system—months after their infection. In rare cases, some individuals may develop new symptoms (called sequelae) that stem from but were not present at the time of initial infection. People who require intensive care for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, regardless of the cause, usually have a long period of recovery. Individuals with long-term effects, whether following mild or more severe COVID-19, have in some cases self-identified as having “long COVID” or “long haul COVID.” These long-term symptoms are included in the scientific term, P ost A cute S equelae of SARS- C oV-2 Infection (PASC).

top

What are possible long-term neurological complications of COVID-19?

Researchers are following some known acute effects of the virus to determine their relationship to the post-acute complications of COVID-19 infection. These post-acute effects usually include fatigue in combination with a series of other symptoms. These may include trouble with concentration and memory, sleep disorders, fluctuating heart rate and alternating sense of feeling hot or cold, cough, shortness of breath, problems with sleep, inability to exercise to previous normal levels, feeling sick for a day or two after exercising (post-exertional malaise), and pain in muscle, joints, and chest. It is not yet known how the infection leads to these persistent symptoms and why in some individuals and not others.

Nerve damage, including peripheral neuropathy

Some symptoms experienced by some people weeks to months after COVID infection suggest the peripheral nervous system, the vast communication network that sends signals between the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord) and all other parts of the body, is impaired. Peripheral nerves send many types of sensory information to the central nervous system (CNS), such as a message that the feet are cold. They also carry signals from the CNS to the rest of the body, including those that control voluntary movement. Nerve dysfunction is also a known complication in those with critical care illness such as the acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Symptoms of peripheral neuropathy vary depending on the type of nerves – motor, sensory, or autonomic – that are damaged.

Motor nerves control the movement of all muscles under conscious control, such as those used for walking, grasping things, or talking. Damage to the motor nerves can cause muscle weakness and cramps.

control the movement of all muscles under conscious control, such as those used for walking, grasping things, or talking. Damage to the motor nerves can cause muscle weakness and cramps. Sensory nerves carry messages from our sense of touch, sight, hearing, taste, and smell. Sensory nerves transmit information such as the feeling of a light touch, temperature, or pain. The symptoms of sensory nerve damage can include loss of sense of touch, temperature, and pain or a tingling sensation.

carry messages from our sense of touch, sight, hearing, taste, and smell. Sensory nerves transmit information such as the feeling of a light touch, temperature, or pain. The symptoms of sensory nerve damage can include loss of sense of touch, temperature, and pain or a tingling sensation. Autonomic nerves control organs to regulate activities that people do not control consciously, such as breathing, digestion, and heart and gland functions. Common symptoms include excess or absence of sweating, heat intolerance, and drop in blood pressure upon standing. Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (also known as POTS) can increase heart rate when standing up and cause such symptoms as lightheadedness (or fainting) or difficulty concentrating.

Fatigue and post-exertional malaise.

The most common persistent symptom weeks and months after COVID-19 infection is fatigue. The fatigue is similar to what one experiences with many viral infections such as the flu. The sense of fatigue can be brought on by both physical and mental activity. Some people are unable to return to work or school after COVID-19 due to fatigue, while others find it extremely difficult to accomplish their normal level of activity. Tasks such as walking the dog or going shopping can cause extreme tiredness and fatigue; some people can’t carry out everyday activities without feeling pain or tiredness. COVID-related complications such as depressed heart, lung, or kidney function, poor sleep, or muscle deconditioning are known to cause fatigue and affect the ability to exercise. Fatigue is very common in most inflammatory conditions. The cause(s) of fatigue in many of those suffering weeks and months after COVID-19 is not known.

Post-exertional malaise (PEM) is a condition in which otherwise usual activities are followed by a period of very severe fatigue and sense of feeling sick. PEM can occur with a delay after the activity, but can last for days thereafter.

Cognitive impairment/altered mental state

People with severe acute COVID-19 illness may develop confusion, delirium, and a depressed level of consciousness. Those suffering from post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 frequently have difficulty concentrating and memory problems, sometimes called “brain fog.” This impairment is a common symptom in those with severe fatigue of any cause. A variety of immune, metabolic, or blood vessel abnormalities or drug effects can contribute to the dramatic effects on cognitive function in the acute infection. Whether these also underlie the problems experienced weeks or months after mild or moderate illness is not known.

Muscle, joint, and chest pain

Some people continue to report pain in a muscle or group of muscles (myalgia), aching joints, and fatigue after recovering from the initial course of the virus. Persistent muscle pain and chest pain is commonly reported by persons recovering from ARDS, but is now being reported by those who had a mild or moderate infectious illness. Some individuals also have a sense of shortness of breath despite testing normal on pulmonary function tests.

Prolonged/lingering loss of smell (anosmia) or taste

Some people who have had COVID-19 may lose their sense of taste or smell, or the sensation of flavor. The loss of sense of taste or smell is characteristic of COVID-19 because the SARS-CoV-2 virus infects the tissue that forms the lining in the nose. The virus has been found to target certain cells in the nose that support the nerve cells. Those nerve cells detect odors and send that information to the brain. Damage to these supporting cells can cause smell or taste loss that can continue for weeks or months as these cells repair themselves or are replaced by new cells. During the recovery period some odors may smell different - even sometimes unpleasant or foul - than people remeber prior to being infected.

Persistent fevers and chills

Some people who recover from their acute (short-term) infection continue to have on-and-off fever, along with chills and body ache. Some people have a high, prolonged fever after the infection is gone, which might contribute to the sense of fatigue. In some instances, people who recover from the initial infection may have temperature dysregulation, in which it’s difficult for the body to keep a normal temperature.

Prolonged respiratory effects and lung damage

COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory disease that can seriously affect the lungs during and after the infection. Some people with the disease have breathing difficulties and some require supplemental oxygen support or mechanical ventilation via a respirator. The disease also can damage the muscles that help us breathe. Lung injury can cause low blood oxygen and brain hypoxia, which occurs when the brain isn’t getting enough oxygen. This can lead to cognitive impairment, seizures, stroke, and permanent damage to the brain and other organs. Results from several studies show that, even in people who have had mild-to-moderate infection, the effects of COVID-19 can persist in the lungs for months. Some people develop pneumonia after their acute illness has passed. Several people need pulmonary (lung) rehabilitation to rebuild their lung function. Studies show several people who had the infection, particularly those who had a more severe course of illness, also develop scarring of the lung and permanent lung dysfunction.

Headaches

Headaches are often among the many symptoms that can accompany infection from the coronavirus. Some people continue to have mild to serious headaches sometimes for weeks after recovery. The sensation of pressure is different from a migraine, which may be brought on by stress. The headaches may be infrequent or occur chronically (some people report having daily headache).

Sleep disturbances

Some people with long-term neurological effects from the SARS-CoV-2 infection report having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep (insomnia), excessive daytime sleepiness (hypersomnia), unrefreshing sleep, and changes in sleep patterns. It may be difficult for some people to wake up and fall asleep at their regular times. Depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can negatively affect sleep. Sleep disorders can contribute to fatigue and cognitive troubles. Some people report an increase in pain, headache, and stress because of lack of sleep. Continued loss of sleep also negatively affects attention and mood. For more information about COVID-19’s effect on sleep (as well as on the respiratory system) and tips to improve sleep, see the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.

Anxiety, depression, and stress post-COVID

The outbreak of COVID-19 is stressful for many people. People respond to stress in different ways and it is normal to experience a range of emotions, including fear, anxiety, and grief. Being isolated from others during the infection, the real risk of death, and the stress of hospitalization and critical care can trigger post-traumatic stress disorder. In addition, given the contagious nature of COVID-19, the individual is often not the only affected person in the family or circle of friends, some of whom may even have died. Some people may develop a mood or anxiety disorder. For information on post-COVID stress and coping, see the National Institute of Mental Health’s resources at National Institute of Mental Health's (NIMH) Director, Dr. Gordon In the News and NIMH Shareable Resources on Coping with COVID-19.

How do the long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection/COVID-19 relate to Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS)?

Some of the symptom clusters reported by people still suffering months after their COVID-19 infection overlap with symptoms described by individuals with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). People with a diagnosis of ME/CFS have wide-ranging and debilitating effects including fatigue, PEM, unrefreshing sleep, cognitive difficulties, postural orthostatic tachycardia, and joint and muscle pain. Unfortunately, many people with ME/CFS do not return to pre-disease levels of activity. The cause of ME/CFS is unknown but many people report its onset after an infectious-like illness. Rest, conserving energy, and pacing activities are important to feeling better but don’t cure the disease. Although the long-term symptoms of COVID-19 may share features with it, ME/CFS is defined by symptom-based criteria and there are no tests that confirm an ME/CFS diagnosis.

ME/CFS is not diagnosed until the key features, especially severe fatigue, post-exertional malaise, and unrefreshing sleep, are present for greater than six months. It is now becoming more apparent that following infection with SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19, some individuals may continue to exhibit these symptoms beyond six months and qualify for an ME/CFS diagnosis. It is unknown how many people will develop ME/CFS after SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is possible that many individuals with ME/CFS, and other disorders impacting the nervous system, may benefit greatly if research on the long-term effects of COVID-19 uncovers the cause of debilitating symptoms including intense fatigue, problems with memory and concentration, and pain.

Am I at a higher risk if I currently have a neurological disorder?

Much is still unknown about the coronavirus but people having one of several underlying medical conditions may have an increased risk of illness. However, not everyone with an underlying condition will be at risk of developing severe illness. People who have a neurological disorder may want to discuss their concerns with their doctors.

Because COVID-19 is a new virus, there is little information on the risk of getting the infection in people who have a neurological disorder. People with any of these conditions might be at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19:

Cerebrovascular disease

Stroke

Obesity

Dementia

Diabetes

High blood pressure

There is evidence that COVID-19 seems to disproportionately affect some racial and ethnic populations, perhaps because of higher rates of pre-existing conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and lung disease. Social determinants of health (such as access to health care, poverty, education, ability to remain socially distant, and where people live and work) also contribute to increased health risk and outcomes.

top

Can COVID-19 cause other neurological disorders?

In some people, response to the coronavirus has been shown to increase the risk of stroke, dementia, muscle and nerve damage, encephalitis, and vascular disorders. Some researchers think the unbalanced immune system caused by reacting to the coronavirus may lead to autoimmune diseases, but it's too early to tell.

Anecdotal reports of other diseases and conditions that may be triggered by the immune system response to COVID-19 include para-infectious conditions that occur within days to a few weeks after infection:

Multi-system infammatory syndrome - which causes inflammation in the body's blood vessels

Transverse myelitis - an inflammation of the spinal cord

Guillain-Barré sydrome (sometimes known as acute polyradiculoneuritis) - a rare neurological disorder which can range from brief weakness to nearly devastating paralysis, leaving the person unable to breathe independently

Dysautonomia - dysfunction of the autonomic nerve system, which is involved with functions such a breathing, heart rate, and temperature control

Acute disseminating encephalomyelitis (ADEM) - an attack on the protective myelin covering of nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord

Acute necrotizing hemorrhagic encephalopathy - a rare type of brain disease that causes lesions in certain parts of the brain and bleeding (hemorrhage) that can cause tissue death (necrosis)

Facial nerve palsies (lack of function of a facial nerve) such as Bell's Palsy

Parkinson's disease-like symptoms have been reported in a few individuals who had no family history or early signs of the disease

Does the COVID-19 vaccine cause neurological problems?

Almost everyone should get the COVID-19 vaccination. It will help protect you from getting COVID-19. The vaccines are safe and effective and cannot give you the disease. Most side effects of the vaccine may feel like flu and are temporary and go away within a day or two. In early vaccine development, there were extremely rare reports of unexplained neurological illness following COVID-19 vaccination, but regulators found no evidence the vaccines caused the illness. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) continues to investigate any report of adverse consequences of the vaccine and none have appeared as of yet. Consult your primary care doctor or specialist if you have concerns regarding any pre-existing known allergic or other severe reactions and vaccine safety. Scientists are studying the risk to benefit ratio of the vaccine in someone who previously developed Guillain Barré syndrome after a vaccination. The general sense is the COVID-19 vaccine is safe in individuals whose Guillain-Barré syndrome was not associated with a previous vaccination.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) site offers information on vaccine resources at https://www.coronavirus.gov/. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has information on vaccines for the coronavirus. See: https://covid19.nih.gov/.

309,Long-Term Effects of COVID-19,"Types of Post-COVID Conditions

Long COVID

Long COVID is a range of symptoms that can last weeks or months after first being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 or can appear weeks after infection. Long COVID can happen to anyone who has had COVID-19, even if the illness was mild, or they had no symptoms. People with long COVID report experiencing different combinations of the following symptoms:

Tiredness or fatigue

Difficulty thinking or concentrating (sometimes referred to as “brain fog”)

Headache

Loss of smell or taste

Dizziness on standing

Fast-beating or pounding heart (also known as heart palpitations)

Chest pain

Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath

Cough

Joint or muscle pain

Depression or anxiety

Fever

Symptoms that get worse after physical or mental activities

Multiorgan Effects of COVID-19

Multiorgan effects can affect most, if not all, body systems including heart, lung, kidney, skin, and brain functions. Multiorgan effects can also include conditions that occur after COVID-19, like multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) and autoimmune conditions. MIS is a condition where different body parts can become swollen. Autoimmune conditions happen when your immune system attacks healthy cells in your body by mistake, causing painful swelling in the affected parts of the body.

It is unknown how long multiorgan system effects might last and whether the effects could lead to chronic health conditions.

Effects of COVID-19 Treatment or Hospitalization

Post-COVID conditions also can include the longer-term effects of COVID-19 treatment or hospitalization. Some of these longer-term effects are similar to those related to hospitalization for other respiratory infections or other conditions.

Effects of COVID-19 treatment and hospitalization can also include post-intensive care syndrome (PICS), which refers to health effects that remain after a critical illness. These effects can include severe weakness and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD involves long-term reactions to a very stressful event.",www.cdc.gov
310,Dr. Ben Cowling on Super Spreading of COVID-19,"Q&A

Dr. Ben Cowling on Super Spreading of COVID-19

Ben Cowling, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at the University of Hong Kong

Excerpts from our conversation with Dr. Ben Cowling, an NIH-funded epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong.

NIHNiH: What is “super spreading,” and how is it driving the COVID-19 pandemic?

Cowling: We looked at infections in Hong Kong. And what we found is that infections often occurred in clusters. So although on average, one person may have been infecting two others, actually, a lot of the cases didn’t infect anyone.

We found that 70% of cases didn’t affect anyone, didn’t transmit at all. And about 20% of cases were responsible for 80% of transmission. That’s called super-spreading.

NIHNiH: Has this pattern been seen before? Is it limited to Hong Kong?

Cowling: We observe that the minority of cases are responsible for a majority of transmission. It’s not the first time we've seen that happening. That happened for SARS (another coronavirus) in 2003. It happens for MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) coronavirus, as well. And now we think it happens for COVID.

Although our research is in Hong Kong, using Hong Kong data, actually the same kind of phenomenon has been reported elsewhere. And we believe it’s actually what’s happening a lot of the time with COVID in the U.S. as well.

NIHNiH: How does super spreading occur?

Cowling: You need to have a lot of people around a contagious case. If there’s a contagious person who isolates themselves once they worry they’re infected, there won’t be any superspreading because there won’t be an opportunity. You also need the case to be a relatively more contagious case. We’ve found that there’s a lot of variability in contagiousness.

One of the questions we still haven’t answered is: What makes a super-spreader? What is it about those people that makes them more contagious and more likely to transmit to lots of other people? We haven’t really identified it. Maybe there’s some genetic component. Maybe there’s some other factor related to age or social behavior.

NIHNiH: How can we reduce super spreading?

Cowling: If we can find ways to minimize the opportunity for super-spreading events, it would really help a lot. And so that means in the U.S., things like either making sure bars are closed or operating in reduced capacity or with better ventilation. Same for restaurants. Workplaces really need to think about not having a crowded cubicle area, where if there was one infected person in the middle that they could spread it to everyone. Public transport may need to be more careful, especially on public transport that has longer journeys.

NIHNiH: How will limiting super spreading help?

Cowling: If we can find ways to remove one of those ingredients for super-spreading events—and that’s the opportunity—then it can go a long way to reducing transmission. So that’s really, in my opinion, an important approach.

If we can reduce crowding, then we can actually do a lot of good without having to have drastic stay-at-home orders. We can still let people do some of the things they want to do.",newsinhealth.nih.gov
311,How Long Does Protection Last After COVID-19?,"Health Capsule

How Long Does Protection Last After COVID-19?

NIAID Integrated Research Facility, Fort Detrick, Maryland

After your body’s disease defense system (the immune system) fights off a virus, it keeps a memory of it. A study suggests that people’s immune systems remember COVID-19 for months after recovery.

The immune system makes different types of cells and molecules to fight disease. These include antibodies, T cells, and B cells.

Researchers looked at immune responses from about 200 people who’d recovered from COVID-19. Some had been infected up to eight months before the analysis. Other cases were more recent. Of the people who recovered, 95% had immune system “memories” of the virus that causes COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2.

Almost everyone had antibodies that block the virus’ spike protein. The virus uses this protein to enter cells. The number and type of antibodies varied between people. But the levels usually remained stable over time. They slightly decreased six to eight months after infection.

Immune cell levels also remained high. Memory B cells, which make antibodies, increased for a few months after infection and then remained stable. Most people had one important type of T cell. About half had another type of T cell that kills infected cells.

“Several months ago, our studies showed that natural infection induced a strong response, and this study now shows that the responses last,” says Dr. Daniela Weiskopf at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology. “We are hopeful that a similar pattern of responses lasting over time will also emerge for the vaccine-induced responses.”",newsinhealth.nih.gov
312,Understanding COVID-19: How To Protect Yourself During the Pandemic,"Understanding COVID-19

How To Protect Yourself During the Pandemic

COVID-19 has claimed millions of lives around the world. But we learn more about this disease every day. Scientists are developing tools that promise to slow and eventu­ally help us overcome the pandemic.

COVID-19 is caused by a new coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. There are many types of coronaviruses. Some cause the common cold. Others have led to fatal disease outbreaks. These include severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012, and now COVID-19.

Coronaviruses are named for the crown-like spikes on their surface. (Corona means crown.) The viruses use the spikes to help get inside your body’s cells. Once inside, they replicate, or make copies of themselves.

Scientists have learned how to turn these spikes against the virus through vaccines and treatments. They’ve also learned what you can do to protect yourself from the virus.

Protecting Yourself

You’re most likely to get COVID-19 through close contact with someone who’s infected. Coughing, sneezing, talking, and breathing produce small droplets of liquid. These are called respiratory droplets. They travel through the air and can be inhaled by someone else.

“COVID-19 is spread mainly through exposure to respiratory droplets that tend to drop within six feet,” says Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. That’s why it’s important to stay at least six feet (about two arm lengths) away from people who don’t live with you.

“Surfaces can be contaminated. But it is likely that this is a less common cause of infection rather than person-to-person directly,” Fauci says.

You can protect yourself and others by wearing a mask. Choose one that has at least two layers of fabric. Make sure that the mask covers your mouth and nose and doesn’t leak air around the edges.

“There’s very little transmission in places where masks are worn,” says Dr. Ben Cowling at the University of Hong Kong who studies how viruses spread. Cowling found that infections were most often spread in settings where masks aren’t worn.

“Masks work. But even with mandatory masking, you still need social distancing as well,” he says. You can lower your risk by avoiding crowds. Crowds increase the risk of coming in contact with someone who has COVID-19.

What to Look For

Common symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, headaches, fatigue, and muscle or body aches. People with COVID-19 may also lose their sense of smell or taste. Symptoms usually appear two to 14 days after being exposed to the virus.

But even people who don’t seem sick can still infect others. The CDC estimates that 50% of infections are spread by people with no symptoms. While some with this virus develop life-threatening illness, others have mild symptoms, and some never develop any.

Catching the virus is more dangerous for some groups of people. This includes older adults and people with certain medical conditions. These medical conditions include obesity, diabetes, heart and lung disease, and asthma. About 40% of Americans have at least one of these risk factors.

Getting Treatment

Better COVID-19 treatments mean that fewer people now get severely sick if they catch the virus. Scientists have been working to test available drugs against the virus. They’ve found at least two that can help people who are hospitalized with the virus.

A drug called remdesivir can reduce the time a patient spends in the hospital. A steroid called dexamethasone helps stop the immune systemThe system that protects your body from invading viruses, bacteria, and other microscopic threats. from reacting too strongly to the virus. That can damage body tissues and organs.

Antibody treatments are also available. Antibodies are proteins that your body makes to fight germs. Scientists have learned how to make them in the lab. Antibody treatments can block SARS-CoV-2 to prevent the illness from getting worse. They seem to have the most benefit when given early in the disease.

“Antibody treatments really do have the potential to help people, especially for treating individuals who are not yet hospitalized,” says Dr. Mark Heise, who studies the genetics of viruses at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Heise is working to develop mouse models to test treatments and vaccines.

Studies are now testing combinations of treatments. “Combining drugs that target both the virus and the person’s immune response may help treat COVID-19,” says Heise. Scientists are also looking for new drugs that better target the virus.

A Shot of Hope: Vaccines

It used to take a decade or more to develop a new vaccine. In this pandemic, scientists created COVID-19 vaccines in less than a year.

The first two vaccines approved for emergency use are from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech. Moderna’s vaccine was co-developed with NIH scientists. Both are a new type of vaccine called mRNA vaccines. mRNA carries the genetic information for your body to make proteins.

The vaccines direct the body’s cells to make a piece of the virus called the spike protein. These proteins can’t cause illness by themselves. But they teach your immune system to make antibodies against the protein. If you encounter the virus later, the antibodies provide protection against it.

The mRNA vaccines now available were shown to be more than 90% effective in large clinical trials. They can cause side effects—such as fatigue, muscle aches, joint pain, and headache. But both vaccines were found to be safe in the clinical trials.

“Get vaccinated. The vaccines are safe. They’re incredibly effective,” says Dr. Jason McLellan, an expert on coronaviruses at the University of Texas at Austin. McLellan’s research was critical in developing these vaccines. His team, along with NIH scientists, figured out how to lock the shape of the spike protein to make the most effective antibodies.

As the pandemic has gone on, new versions of the virus, or variants, have appeared. “We’re all very confident that vaccines will continue to work well against these variants,” McLellan says. “Vaccination also helps stop the development of new variants, because it provides fewer opportunities for the virus to change as it replicates.”

Many people will need to be vaccinated for the pandemic to end. Fauci estimates that 70% to 85% of the U.S. population will need to be vaccinated to get “herd immunity.” That’s the point where enough people are immune to the virus to prevent its spread. That’s important because it protects vulnerable people who can’t get vaccinated.

“It is my hope that all Americans will protect themselves by getting vaccinated when the vaccine becomes available to them,” Fauci says. “That is how our country will begin to heal and move forward.”",newsinhealth.nih.gov
313,Pediatric Obstructive Sleep Apnea,"Overview

Pediatric obstructive sleep apnea is a sleep disorder in which your child's breathing is partially or completely blocked repeatedly during sleep. The condition is due to narrowing or blockage of the upper airway during sleep.

There are differences between pediatric obstructive sleep apnea and adult sleep apnea. While adults usually have daytime sleepiness, children are more likely to have behavioral problems. The underlying cause in adults is often obesity, while in children the most common underlying condition is enlargement of the adenoids and tonsils.

Early diagnosis and treatment are important to prevent complications that can affect children's growth, cognitive development and behavior.

Symptoms

During sleep, signs and symptoms of pediatric sleep apnea might include:

Snoring

Pauses in breathing

Restless sleep

Snorting, coughing or choking

Mouth breathing

Nighttime sweating

Bed-wetting

Sleep terrors

Infants and young children with obstructive sleep apnea don't always snore. They might just have disturbed sleep.

During the day, children with sleep apnea might:

Perform poorly in school

Have difficulty paying attention

Have learning problems

Have behavioral problems

Have poor weight gain

Be hyperactive

When to see a doctor

Make an appointment with your child's doctor if your child consistently wakes up in the morning feeling tired and has behavioral problems.

Causes

Obesity is a common factor underlying obstructive sleep apnea in adults. But in children the most common condition leading to obstructive sleep apnea is enlarged tonsils and adenoids. However, obesity also plays a role in children. Other underlying factors can be craniofacial anomalies and neuromuscular disorders.

Risk factors

Besides obesity, other risk factors for pediatric sleep apnea include having:

Down syndrome

Abnormalities in the skull or face

Cerebral palsy

Sickle cell disease

Neuromuscular disease

History of low birth weight

Family history of obstructive sleep apnea

Complications

Pediatric obstructive sleep apnea can have serious complications, including:",www.mayoclinic.org

Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR TB)

What is tuberculosis (TB)?

Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease caused by bacteria that are spread from person to person through the air. TB usually affects the lungs, but it can also affect other parts of the body, such as the brain, the kidneys, or the spine. In most cases, TB is treatable and curable; however, persons with TB can die if they do not get proper treatment.

What is multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB)?

Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR TB) is caused by an organism that is resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampin, the two most potent TB drugs. These drugs are used to treat all persons with TB disease.

What is extensively drug resistant tuberculosis (XDR TB)?

Extensively drug resistant TB (XDR TB) is a rare type of MDR TB that is resistant to isoniazid and rifampin, plus any fluoroquinolone and at least one of three injectable second-line drugs (i.e., amikacin, kanamycin, or capreomycin).

Because XDR TB is resistant to the most potent TB drugs, patients are left with treatment options that are much less effective.

XDR TB is of special concern for persons with HIV infection or other conditions that can weaken the immune system. These persons are more likely to develop TB disease once they are infected, and also have a higher risk of death once they develop TB.

How is TB spread?

Drug-susceptible TB and drug-resistant TB are spread the same way. TB bacteria are put into the air when a person with TB disease of the lungs or throat coughs, sneezes, speaks, or sings. These bacteria can float in the air for several hours, depending on the environment. Persons who breathe in the air containing these TB bacteria can become infected.

TB is not spread by

Shaking someone’s hand

Sharing food or drink

Touching bed linens or toilet seats

Sharing toothbrushes

Kissing

How does drug resistance happen?

Resistance to anti-TB drugs can occur when these drugs are misused or mismanaged. Examples include when patients do not complete their full course of treatment; when health-care providers prescribe the wrong treatment, the wrong dose, or length of time for taking the drugs; when the supply of drugs is not always available; or when the drugs are of poor quality.

Who is at risk for getting MDR TB?

Drug resistance is more common in people who:

Do not take their TB medicine regularly

Do not take all of their TB medicine as told by their doctor or nurse

Develop TB disease again, after having taken TB medicine in the past

Come from areas of the world where drug-resistant TB is common

Have spent time with someone known to have drug-resistant TB disease

How can MDR TB be prevented?

The most important thing a person can do to prevent the spread of MDR TB is to take all of their medications exactly as prescribed by their health care provider. No doses should be missed and treatment should not be stopped early. Patients should tell their health care provider if they are having trouble taking the medications. If patients plan to travel, they should talk to their health care providers and make sure they have enough medicine to last while away.

Health care providers can help prevent MDR TB by quickly diagnosing cases, following recommended treatment guidelines, monitoring patients’ response to treatment, and making sure therapy is completed.

Another way to prevent getting MDR TB is to avoid exposure to known MDR TB patients in closed or crowded places such as hospitals, prisons, or homeless shelters. If you work in hospitals or health-care settings where TB patients are likely to be seen, you should consult infection control or occupational health experts. Ask about administrative and environmental procedures for preventing exposure to TB. Once those procedures are implemented, additional measures could include using personal respiratory protective devices.

Is there a vaccine to prevent TB?

Yes, there is a vaccine for TB disease called Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG). It is used in some countries to prevent severe forms of TB in children. However, BCG is not generally recommended in the United States because it has limited effectiveness for preventing TB overall.

What should I do if I think I have been exposed to someone with TB disease?

If you think you have been exposed to someone with TB disease, you should contact your doctor or local health department about getting a TB skin test or TB blood test. And tell the doctor or nurse when you spent time with this person.

What are the symptoms of TB disease?

The general symptoms of TB disease include feelings of sickness or weakness, weight loss, fever, and night sweats. The symptoms of TB disease of the lungs may also include coughing, chest pain, and coughing up blood. Symptoms of TB disease in other parts of the body depend on the area affected. If you have these symptoms, you should contact your doctor or local health department.

315,Allergens in Cosmetics,"Cosmetic products (such as soaps, lotions, face and eye make up, fragrances, etc.) can provoke allergic reactions in some people. Many people suffer from allergies and anyone at any age can develop allergies. Allergic reactions are the immune system’s overreaction to substances that may otherwise be harmless. An allergen can trigger the immune system to release chemical substances such as antibodies that result in allergy symptoms. Many people are familiar with seasonal allergies brought on by pollen from blooming plants, or with food allergies. Allergic reactions to cosmetics most often appear as itchy, red rashes on the skin – or contact dermatitis.

This page provides information about:

Common Allergens Found in Cosmetic Products

The FDA has compiled the list below of common allergens found in some cosmetic products. These are allergens that cause most allergic reactions from the use of cosmetic products.

Common allergens fall into the five classes as detailed below: natural rubber, fragrances, preservatives, dyes, and metals.

What Consumers Can Do

Regarding possible allergens in cosmetics, the best way to prevent an allergic reaction is to know what you are sensitive to and how to avoid it. One way to accomplish this is by carefully reading the product ingredient panel and avoiding ingredients you know or think you are allergic to. It isn’t enough to check for terms like “hypoallergenic”, “fragrance-free” or “for sensitive skin,” as there is no federal standard or definition that governs the use of these terms in the U.S. However, under the authority of the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (FPLA), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires an ingredient declaration on cosmetic products sold at the retail level to consumers. However, certain ingredients may be listed generally as “fragrance,” or “perfume,” without identifying the specific ingredients.

If you have reviewed the product ingredient panel and still have questions regarding the substances in the product, you may contact the manufacturer listed in the product label. In addition, consumers should always check product labels and follow the manufacturer instructions before applying as directed. Reading the label on products is especially important as some products contain ingredients that may cause irritation, regardless of whether you have allergies or not. For example, manufacturers of certain hair dyes instruct users to test a small amount of product first – to see if they have a sensitivity to the ingredients in the product before applying it more broadly.

Symptoms of Allergic Reactions

Allergic reactions can range in severity, but may include hives, itchy skin, a rash, flaking or peeling skin, facial swelling, irritation of the eyes, nose and mouth, wheezing, and anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction that can be life-threatening. Symptoms of anaphylaxis include a lack of consciousness, shortness of breath, trouble swallowing, lightheadedness, chest pain, a rapid, weak pulse, nausea, and vomiting. If anaphylaxis symptoms occur, seek medical attention immediately.

In addition to allergic contact dermatitis, fragrance ingredients may also affect the respiratory system because they are essentially vapor and can be inhaled. This is especially true in patients with asthma, allergic rhinitis, and viral respiratory infections. For people with sensitivities to certain fragrances, inhaling them may result in shortness of breath, the sensation of being suffocated, coughing, phlegm, a runny or stuffy nose, headache, chest tightness, and wheezing.

If you experience symptoms of what you suspect is an allergic reaction, consult your healthcare professional, as sensitivity to allergens can become more severe over time. Be sure to discuss with your healthcare provider what product or particular substance you think might be triggering the allergic reaction. They may recommend different types of tests to better understand what you are allergic to.

If you believe you have experienced an adverse event (allergic reaction or illness) after using a cosmetic product, you can also submit a report to the FDA. The FDA encourages consumers with questions about cosmetic products to submit inquiries.

Testing for Allergens

There is some good news. You don’t have to wait until you have an allergic reaction to try and figure out what you are allergic to. You can get tested. Knowing precisely what allergen has caused a reaction will help you to avoid further exposure to the substance. Your healthcare provider may recommend you undergo patch testing or some other, less frequently used tests.

Patch Test

This test is often used to diagnose dermatitis, or irritation and swelling of the skin. This test involves placing a small amount of allergen on the skin and covering it for 48 hours. A doctor will inspect the skin after 72 to 96 hours and check for signs of an allergic reaction, including, redness, a rash, or hives. Based on the symptoms present, the physician can determine whether the patient has had an allergic reaction. Patch testing requires two to three office visits.



If a patient has very sensitive skin, this type of testing may not be specific enough to help identify allergens and other methods may be used.

Other Testing Types Less Frequently Used: Prick Test

This type of testing involves placing an allergen on the patient’s skin and pricking the skin in that same spot with a needle. The areas that were pricked (usually on the forearms) are then monitored. Redness, itching, or swelling may develop if the person is allergic to the substance.

The areas that were pricked (usually on the forearms) are then monitored. Redness, itching, or swelling may develop if the person is allergic to the substance. Intradermal Test

This test is like the prick test; however, for this test, allergens are injected into the top layer of skin and monitored for any signs of allergic reaction; redness, swelling, itching, etc.

This test is like the prick test; however, for this test, allergens are injected into the top layer of skin and monitored for any signs of allergic reaction; redness, swelling, itching, etc. Allergy Blood Test

This test involves taking a blood sample from a patient and adding an allergen to it to see if antibodies are created. If antibodies are produced in response to the allergen, then the patient is likely allergic to that substance.

FDA Activities on Allergens in Cosmetics

To better understand allergens in cosmetics, the FDA focuses its efforts around three main areas:

Monitoring of adverse event reporting;

Conducting scientific research on the mechanisms of allergic reactions and how allergens interact with the body’s immune system; and

Conducting research on consumer practices, the frequency of adverse reactions, and consumer awareness of allergens in cosmetics.

Monitoring Adverse Event Reporting

Adverse event reports contain critical medical information and descriptions that help the FDA identify signals of potential safety issues with cosmetic products and ingredients. The FDA receives adverse event reports from healthcare professionals and consumers via MedWatch. The FDA reviews all adverse event reports and when necessary, takes action to address safety issues associated with cosmetic products and ingredients.

More information on adverse event reporting can be found at the How to Report a Cosmetic Related Complaint page.

Scientific Research on Cosmetic Allergens

The FDA is interested in better understanding how allergens interact with the body’s immune system. To do this, FDA scientists are collaborating with scientists at the National Center for Natural Products Research at the University of Mississippi and University of Florida. Through these partnerships we can better understand how allergic reactions are induced, and we are identifying new ingredients capable of inducing allergic reaction. We are working with our research partners to develop animal-free testing methods to identify potential allergens and are exploring whether allergen testing data can help us further identify potential allergenic ingredients in cosmetic products. We are also exploring the existing data for quality and potential gaps.

The FDA is also engaged in research specific to fragrance ingredients. The study’s purpose is to identify the likelihood of an adverse reaction from the use of products containing fragrance ingredients. This project will help establish acceptable levels for multiple fragrance ingredients used in a variety of rinse-off and leave-on cosmetic products. The methodology established in this project may be used in future studies to perform similar assessments for additional cosmetics ingredients.

Additional Information

Enhancing our scientific understanding of allergens however, is only one area of interest for the agency. The FDA is also taking steps to learn more about consumer practices and use of cosmetics. We are conducting consumer surveys and focus groups to collect the following information:

How consumers use cosmetics;

How often consumers experience an adverse reaction from the use of cosmetics with potential allergens;

How aware are consumers of the presence of allergens in cosmetics; and

What actions (if any) do consumers take to avoid allergens in cosmetics.

In addition, the FDA intends to conduct interviews with the cosmetics industry to understand how manufacturing, marketing, and sale of cosmetic products is impacted by information on allergic reactions to cosmetic products. Furthermore, from interviews with state and local regulatory authorities, the FDA hopes to learn about their awareness of safety issues associated with cosmetic ingredients, including potential allergens, and how they monitor and address these issues.

316,Formaldehyde in Hair Smoothing Products: What You Should Know,"Image

Español

If you decide that you want to make your hair less frizzy or straighter, you may choose to go to a professional stylist at a hair salon for a hair straightening or smoothing service. Most hair smoothing or straightening products release formaldehyde gas, a known human carcinogen as classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, into the air during the hair straightening or smoothing process. Formaldehyde exposure can cause both short- and long-term effects that may impact your health.

This page provides information about:

What Happens During the Hair Smoothing Process?

Your stylist usually applies a hair straightening or smoothing solution to your hair and follows it with a heat processing step—typically performed with a flat iron device that seals the solution into the strands of the hair. When the solution is heated, the formaldehyde in the product is released into the air as a gas. If the salon is not properly ventilated, you, your stylist, and others in the salon are at risk of inhaling the released formaldehyde.

Why Exposure to Formaldehyde is Dangerous

When formaldehyde is released into the air and is present in the air at levels exceeding 0.1 ppm, it can cause serious irritation of your eyes, nose, and lungs. It can also cause skin sensitivity or allergic dermatitis.

Formaldehyde Exposure: Potential Short-and Long-Term Effects

The greater the exposure to products that contain formaldehyde in terms of both length of time and concentration, the higher the potential health risks. Individuals who have experienced formaldehyde exposure have described reactions such as eye problems or irritation, nervous system problems (for example, headaches and dizziness), respiratory tract problems (sore or scratchy throat, cough, wheezing), nausea, chest pain, vomiting, and rashes. Chronic effects associated with formaldehyde can include an increased prevalence of headaches, asthma, contact dermatitis (a red, itchy rash caused by direct contact with a substance or an allergic reaction to it as a result of sensitization) and possibly cancer.

It’s important to note that some people are very sensitive to formaldehyde, whereas others have no reaction to the same level of exposure. If you are sensitive to formaldehyde, you should not use this type of product.

Steps to Take If You’re Thinking of Using Hair Smoothing Products

Don’t do it yourself. Don’t apply them yourself at home. Go to a licensed hair professional in a salon. Hair professionals should be trained to take precautions such as wearing gloves and safety glasses, as well as making sure that there is proper ventilation when applying hair smoothing products. For more information, please visit OSHA Hair Salons: Facts about Formaldehyde in Hair Products. Read the list of ingredients. While the FDA discourages consumers from buying these products for home use, if you are considering purchasing a product from a store or online to apply yourself, read the required list of ingredients. If there isn’t one, don’t buy the product. If the hair smoothing product lists one of these ingredient names on the packaging or company website: formaldehyde, formalin, or methylene glycol, then it means the product contains formaldehyde or will release formaldehyde. Of note, not all hair smoothing products contain formaldehyde, which is why you need to read the label to see what is in the product. You may also want to ask your salon professional these questions: Does the product contain formaldehyde? Is there an ingredient list available for this product that I could read? Would it be possible for me to review the Safety Data Sheet for this product? Have you been trained to apply this product, and do you know the necessary safeguards to minimize exposure to formaldehyde? May I see your training certificate from the manufacturer and the directions for product use? Does the salon have proper ventilation? Do you periodically test the air for adherence to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s limits for formaldehyde? Do you have an alternative hair smoothing product that does not release formaldehyde when heated? Report bad reactions. If you experience a bad reaction to a hair smoothing product, stop using the product and report your symptoms to your health care provider. You can also report your symptom to the FDA by contacting the Consumer Complaint Coordinator in your area or by reporting them online at MedWatch, the FDA’s safety information and adverse reporting program. You also may call MedWatch at 1-800-332-1088 to request a reporting form by mail.

319,Study of Mosquito Protein Could Lead to Treatments Against Life Threatening Viruses,"Study of mosquito protein could lead to treatments against life-threatening viruses

NIAID

The mosquito protein AEG12 strongly inhibits the family of viruses that cause yellow fever, dengue, West Nile, and Zika and weakly inhibits coronaviruses, according to scientists at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and their collaborators. The researchers found that AEG12 works by destabilizing the viral envelope, breaking its protective covering. Although the protein does not affect viruses that do not have an envelope, such as those that cause pink eye and bladder infections, the findings could lead to therapeutics against viruses that affect millions of people around the world. The research was published online in PNAS.

Scientists at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), part of NIH, used X-ray crystallography to solve the structure of AEG12. Senior author Geoffrey Mueller, Ph.D., head of the NIEHS Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Group, said at the molecular level, AEG12 rips out the lipids, or the fat-like portions of the membrane that hold the virus together.

""It is as if AEG12 is hungry for the lipids that are in the virus membrane, so it gets rid of some of the lipids it has and exchanges them for the ones it really prefers,"" Mueller said. ""The protein has high affinity for viral lipids and steals them from the virus.""

As a result, Mueller says the AEG12 protein has great killing power over some viruses. While the researchers demonstrated that AEG12 was most effective against flaviviruses, the family of viruses to which Zika, West Nile, and others belong, it is possible AEG12 could be effective against SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. But, Mueller said it will take years of bioengineering to make AEG12 a viable therapy for COVID-19. Part of the problem is AEG12 also breaks opens red blood cells, so researchers will have to identify compounds that will make the protein target viruses only.

Alexander Foo, Ph.D., an NIEHS visiting fellow and lead author of the paper, explained that mosquitoes produce AEG12 when they take a blood meal or become infected with flaviviruses. Like humans, mosquitoes mount a vigorous immune response against these viruses, with AEG12 bursting their viral covering. But, at the beginning of the project, Foo and his colleagues knew little about the function of AEG12.

""The prospect of studying a new protein is exciting, yet daunting,"" Foo said. ""Thankfully, we had enough clues and access to a wide range of expertise at NIEHS to piece it together.""

Co-author and crystallography expert Lars Pedersen, Ph.D., is leader of the NIEHS Structure Function Group. He routinely uses information about a molecule’s physical makeup in his work and encourages more scientists to consider using this data in their studies. He said, ""Our research shows that understanding the structure of a protein can be important in figuring out what it does and how it could help treat disease.""

320,Patchy Skin: Vitiligo Explained,"Patchy Skin

Vitiligo Explained

Your skin is often the first thing other people see. You may have noticed that some people have patches of white skin. This discoloring is called vitiligo.

Vitiligo isn’t contagious. It’s an autoimmune disease. That’s a condition in which the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys the body’s own cells.

Normally, your immune system defends your body from germs. But in vitiligo, immune cells kill the cells that produce the skin’s color. These pigment cells are called melanocytes.

Sometimes, vitiligo causes areas of hair to go white as well. People with vitiligo may also develop inflammationHeat, swelling, and redness caused by the body’s protective response to injury or infection. in the eyes or ears. These parts of the body also contain melanocytes.

To diagnose vitiligo, your doctor will look closely at your skin. They may use a special type of light that makes spots of vitiligo look chalky. You might also have a skin sample taken to look for pigment cells.

The condition isn’t painful. But some people experience itching while the skin is losing color, explains Dr. John Harris, a skin expert at the University of Massachusetts.

Some people feel distressed at the loss of their skin’s color. They may develop low self-esteem or a poor self-image from concerns about their appearance.

“Vitiligo can cause a reduction in quality of life, because it tends to involve parts of the body that can’t be hidden,” says Harris. But treatments are available. And special makeup can help hide the discoloring.

Some treatments aim to slow or stop the disease from getting worse. Others may restore the skin’s color. But these can take time to work. And some areas of the body are easier to treat than others.

A type of light therapy called UVB phototherapy is commonly used to treat the disorder. It uses special lamps that encourage the pigment cells in your skin to regrow.

Light therapy works better on some parts of the body than others. For example, it rarely works well on the hands, Harris says, “but the face is the easiest to treat.”

Some people may need medications that suppress the immune system. These can be given as skin creams or pills.

If someone stops treatment, vitiligo comes back, Harris explains. His team is looking for ways to make the immune system “forget” the melanocytes. That would prevent it from attacking them.

Drugs that suppress the immune system “are like cutting the power to the house to turn off the light in your bedroom,” says Harris. “We want to create more targeted therapies.”

In severe cases of vitiligo, surgery or bleaching larger areas of the skin to match the white patches may be options. Talk with your health care provider about what steps you can take to help with the condition. See the Wise Choices box for tips on living with vitiligo.",newsinhealth.nih.gov
321,Vaccine Safety: MedlinePlus Health Topic,"Summary

What are vaccines?

Vaccines play an important role in keeping us healthy. They protect us from serious and sometimes deadly diseases. Vaccines are injections (shots), liquids, pills, or nasal sprays that you take to teach your body's immune system to recognize and defend against harmful germs. The germs could be viruses or bacteria.

Some types of vaccines contain germs that cause disease. But the germs have been killed or weakened enough that they won't make you sick. Some vaccines only contain a part of a germ. Other types of vaccines include instructions for your cells to make a protein of the germ.

These different vaccine types all spark an immune response, which helps your body fight off the germs. Your immune system will also remember the germ and attack it if that germ ever invades again. This protection against a certain disease is called immunity.

These diseases can be very serious. Because of this, getting immunity from a vaccine is safer than getting immunity by being sick with the disease. And for a few vaccines, getting vaccinated can actually give you a better immune response than getting the disease would.

Do vaccines cause side effects?

As with medicines, any vaccine can cause side effects. Most of the time the side effects are minor, such as a sore arm, fatigue, or mild fever. They usually go away within a few days. These common side effects are often a sign that your body is starting to build immunity against a disease.

Serious side effects from vaccines can happen, but they are very rare. These side effects could include a severe allergic reaction. Other possible side effects are different for each vaccine. Talk with your health care provider if you're concerned about your health after getting vaccinated.

Some people worry that childhood vaccines could cause autism spectrum disorder (ASD). But many scientific studies have looked at this and have found no link between vaccines and ASD.

How are vaccines tested for safety?

Every vaccine that is approved in the United States goes through extensive safety testing. It starts with testing and evaluation of the vaccine before it's approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This process can often take several years.

First, the vaccine is tested in labs. Based on those tests, the FDA decides whether to test the vaccine with people.

Testing with people is done through clinical trials. In these trials, the vaccines are tested on volunteers. Clinical trials usually start with 20 to 100 volunteers, but eventually include thousands of volunteers.

The clinical trials have three phases. The trials are looking for the answer to important questions such as Is the vaccine safe? What dose (amount) works best? How does the immune system react to it? How effective is it?

During the process, the FDA works closely with the company who makes the vaccine to evaluate the vaccine's safety and effectiveness. If the vaccine is found to be safe and effective, it will be approved and licensed by the FDA.

After a vaccine is licensed, experts may consider adding it to the recommended vaccine, or immunization, schedule. This schedule is from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

I've heard about heavy metals in baby food. How can I keep my baby safe?

- Keeley

Heavy metals are found in soil, water, and the air we breathe. Plants take up these metals as they grow and can end up in the food we eat. Our bodies need some heavy metals (like iron and zinc) to work well, but other heavy metals (like arsenic and lead) are harmful. Some crops, like rice, absorb more of these harmful metals than others. Heavy metals can build up in the body over time and cause problems with learning, behavior, and attention.

When making baby food, companies add vitamins and minerals along with food additives that may contain heavy metals. Some baby foods have higher levels of heavy metals than others, including:

infant rice cereal

infant rice puff snacks

teething biscuits and rice rusks

fruit juice

carrots and sweet potatoes

Even organic baby food can have heavy metals in it.

The amount of heavy metals is low in baby foods, but you can take steps to lower it even more. Here are ways to do that:",kidshealth.org

And you can catch measles from an infected person even before they have a measles rash.

alert icon Almost everyone who has not had the MMR shot will get measles if they are exposed to the measles virus.

Is measles in the United States?

Every year, unvaccinated U.S. residents get measles while they are abroad and bring the disease into the United States and spread it to others.

Measles is common in other parts of the world, including countries in Europe, Asia, the Pacific Islands, and Africa. When people with measles travel into the United States, they can spread the disease to unvaccinated people including children too young to be vaccinated.

How many measles cases are there in the United States each year?

From year to year, measles cases can range from roughly less than 100 to a couple hundred.

However, in some years, there were more measles cases than usual. In 2019, 1282 people from 31 states were reported as having measles. These measles outbreaks are a key reminder of how quickly diseases can spread when children aren’t vaccinated. Most of these people got measles in the United States after being exposed to someone who got measles while in another country.",www.cdc.gov

My toddler wants to breastfeed only when he’s upset or tired. Is it healthy to continue breastfeeding if nursing has turned into a comfort ritual more than anything else?

Your toddler may turn to nursing for comfort and reassurance, but he is certainly still benefiting from the nutritional and immunologic benefits. In any case, emotional support is a perfectly legitimate aspect of breastfeeding.

Seeking out a reassuring nursing session when he’s upset and bouncing back as soon as he finishes builds your child’s confidence and feelings of security and well-being. Certainly there is no evidence that extended breastfeeding makes a child more dependent or harms him in any way.

On the contrary, many parents proudly tell how independent, healthy, and exceptionally bright their long-term breastfed children become. As long as you are comfortable breastfeeding your toddler, there is no reason to stop.",www.healthychildren.org
326,Healthy Food Choices for Your Family,"Page Content

​How can you ensure that your child is well nourished?

Here are some tips to keep in mind when planning and preparing meals for your family.

Variety

Your child should consume a variety of foods from the five major food groups. Each food group supplies important nutrients, including vitamins and minerals.



The five food groups and typical minimum servings:

Vegetables: 3-5 servings per day. A serving may consist of 1 cup of raw leafy vegetables, 3/4 cup of vegetable juice, or 1/2 cup of other vegetables, chopped raw or cooked.

Fruits: 2-4 servings per day. A serving may consist of 1/2 cup of sliced fruit, 3/4 cup of fruit juice, or a medium-size whole fruit, like an apple, banana, or pear.

Bread, cereal, or pasta: 6-11 servings per day. Each serving should equal 1 slice of bread, 1/2 cup of rice or pasta, or 1 ounce of cereal.

Protein foods: 2-3 servings of 2-3 ounces of cooked lean meat, poultry, or fish per day. A serving in this group may also consist of 1/2 cup of cooked dry beans, one egg, or 2 tablespoons of peanut butter for each ounce of lean meat.

Dairy products: 2-3 servings per day of 1 cup of low-fat milk or yogurt, or 1 1/2 ounces of natural cheese.

Fiber​

Fiber is a carbohydrate component of plant foods that is usually un-digestible. It is found in foods like fruits, vegetables, whole-grain breads, cereals, brown rice, beans, seeds, and nuts.

In adults: Increased fiber has been linked with a reduction of chronic gastrointestinal problems, including colon cancer, irritable bowel syndrome, and diverticulitis.

In children: Fiber's only proven benefit is its ability to ease constipation—providing bulk that can promote regular bowel movements, soften the stools, and decrease the time it takes food to travel through the intestines. But since food preferences and eating habits often get searly in life, and since high-fiber foods contain other nutrients, parents should include these foods in children's daily diets. See Kids Need Fiber: Here's Why and How.

Protein

Your child needs protein so their body can grow and function properly. This includes building new tissues and producing antibodies that help fight infections. Without essential amino acids (the building blocks of protein), children would be much more susceptible to serious diseases.

Protein-rich plants—such as dried beans and peas (legumes), grains, seeds, and nuts—can be used as valuable sources of protein. Other protein-rich foods include meat, fish, milk, yogurt, cheese, and eggs. These animal products contain high-quality protein and a full array of amino acids.

Keep in mind, however, that while red meat and shellfish are rich in protein and an important source of iron, they can also be high in fat and cholesterol as well. So, your child should consume them only in moderate amounts. Select lean cuts of meat and trim the fat before cooking. Likewise, remove skin from poultry before serving.

Fat

Humans cannot live without fats. They are a concentrated source of energy, providing essential fatty acids that are needed for a variety of bodily processes (metabolism, blood clotting, and vitamin absorption).

However, high fat intake—particularly a diet high in saturated fats—can cause problems. Saturated fats are usually solid at room temperatures and are found in fatty meats (such as beef, pork, ham, veal, and lamb) and many dairy products (whole milk, cheese, and ice cream). They can contribute to the buildup of plague in blood vessels and lead to heart disease later in life. A diet rich in saturated fats also can increase blood cholesterol, particularly in people who have inherited a tendency toward high cholesterol levels.

After age two: Children should be served foods that are lower in fat and saturated fats. Chances are that your child's favorite foods are higher in fat than is desirable. Healthy ating means relying more on low-fat, low-cholesterol foods like poultry, fish, and lean meat (broiled, baked, or roasted; not fried), soft margarine (instead of butter), low-fat dairy products, and low-saturated-fat oils from vegetables, while limiting egg consumption.

As a general guideline, fats should make up less than 30% of the calories in your child's diet. No more than about 1/3 or less of those fat calories should come from from saturated fat, with the rest coming from unsaturated (that is, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated) fats. These healthier fats are liquid at room temperature and include vegetable oils like corn, safflower, sunflower, soybean, and olive.

Some parents find the information about various types of fat confusing. In general, oils and fats that come from animals are saturated. The simplest place to start is just to reduce the amount of fatty foods of all types in your family's diet. See How to Reduce Fat and Cholesterol in Your Child's Diet.

Sugar

Limit the amount of sugar in your child's diet to to moderate levels. Sugar has plenty of calories, but dietitians often call them “empty calories"" because they have very little additional nutritional value. Even so, many children consume sugar in large amounts, usually at the expense of healthier foods. When children drink sodas, for example, they are usually leaving the milk in the refrigerator; when they eat a brownie, they may be overlooking the bowl of fruit, a good source of complex carbohydrates, on the kitchen table.

Salt

Table salt, or sodium chloride, may improve the taste of certain foods. However, researchers have found a relationship between salt in the diet and high blood pressure in some people.

High blood pres­sure afflicts about 25% of adult Americans ​​and contributes to heart attacks and strokes.

The habit of using extra salt is an learned one. So, as much as possible, serve your child foods low in salt. In the kitchen, minimize the amount of salt you add to food as you prepare it. Try using herbs, spices, or lemon juice instead. Take the salt shaker off the dinner table, or at least limit its use by your family.

Because salt acts a preservative, processed foods often contain large amounts of it. Salt-rich foods may include processed cheese, instant puddings, canned vegetables, canned soups, hot dogs, cottage cheese, salad dressings, pickles, and potato chips and other snacks.

327,Weaning Your Child,"

Larger text size Large text size Regular text size

What Is Weaning?

Weaning is when a baby moves from breast milk to other sources of nourishment. Weaning your baby is a process that takes patience and understanding from both you and your child.

When Is the Right Time to Wean?

When to wean is a personal decision. A mom might be influenced by a return to work, her health or the baby's, or simply a feeling that the time is right.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends feeding babies only breast milk for the first 6 months of life. After that, the AAP recommends a combination of solid foods and breast milk until a baby is at least 1 year old. Then, babies may begin drinking whole cow's milk.

Most experts agree that breastfeeding should continue for as long as it suits mother and baby. Many women choose to wean after their baby's first birthday. At this age, babies are starting to walk, talk, and eat more solid foods. So they may naturally lose interest in nursing.

Other moms breastfeed longer than a year (this is called extended breastfeeding). Extended breastfeeding is a healthy and reasonable option for mothers and children who aren't ready to wean. In fact, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that moms breastfeed for the first 2 years of a child's life.

Weaning does not have to be all-or-nothing. Some women choose to wean during the day and breastfeed at night, depending on their work situation and their schedules.

Whenever you decide to wean, your child may have another time in mind. Some children wean themselves earlier than the mother intended and others resist weaning when the mother is ready. Those wean later in life tend to be more resistant. For example, a 2-year-old toddler may be more attached and less flexible about giving up breastfeeding than a 12-month-old baby. At times like these, it's important to take it slow and be sensitive to each other's needs.

Signs Your Baby May Be Weaning

Some kids are content to nurse indefinitely. But others will give moms clues that they're ready to begin the process of weaning, such as:

seeming disinterested or fussy when nursing

nursing in shorter sessions than before

being easily distracted while nursing

""playing"" at the breast, like constantly pulling on and off or biting. Babies who bite during nursing should immediately be taken off the breast and told, calmly but firmly, ""No biting. Biting hurts.""

nursing for comfort (sucking at the breast but not drawing out the milk)

Approaches to Weaning

To let both mom and baby adjust physically and emotionally to the change, weaning should be done over time.

One approach is to drop one feeding session a week until your child takes all the feeds from a bottle or cup. If you want to give your child pumped breast milk, you'll need to pump to keep up your milk supply. If you are weaning your child off breast milk, slowly dropping feeds can help avoid engorgement.

You might begin by stopping the midday feeding because it's usually the smallest and most inconvenient — especially for working moms. Many mothers let go of the bedtime feeding last because it's still a special part of bonding.

Some moms leave the decision of when to wean up to their child. Children who are eating three meals of solid food a day (plus snacks) often breastfeed less and less. In that case, a mom's milk will dry up from lack of demand and she'll need to pump to keep the milk flowing. If your child is breastfeeding less, make sure he or she is getting enough iron-fortified formula or milk. Check with the doctor about how much your child should get.

If your baby weans before 1 year of age, or you find that you're not making enough milk, you will need to give your baby formula. Check with the doctor to see what formula is right for your little one.

Making the Change Easier

Weaning is easier if a child has also taken milk from another source. So try giving an occasional bottle of breast milk to your little one after breastfeeding is well-established. Even if you continue breastfeeding, this can ease weaning later. It also lets other family members feed the baby and makes it possible to leave your child with a caregiver.

Remember that infants over 6 months should have solid foods as well as breast milk. After 1 year, breast milk alone does not provide all the nutrients a growing child needs. So solid foods must become a regular part of the diet.

As you start to wean, remember that your child needs time to adjust to drinking from cups. Be patient as your little one begins exploring the world of food.

Here are some more ways to make this change easier:

Engage your child in a fun play activity or an outing during times when you would usually nurse.

Avoid sitting in your usual nursing spots or wearing your usual nursing clothes.

Delay weaning if your child is trying to adapt to some other change. Trying to wean when your little one is just beginning childcare or during teething might not be a good idea.

If your baby is younger than 1 year, try to introduce a bottle or cup when you would typically be nursing. For an older child, try a healthy snack, offering a cup, or maybe a cuddle.

Try changing your daily routine so that you're otherwise engaged during breastfeeding times.

Enlist your partner's help to provide a distraction at a typical nursing time.

If your child picks up a comforting habit (such as thumbsucking) or becomes attached to a security blanket, don't discourage it. Your child might be trying to adjust to the emotional changes of weaning.

How You Might Feel

Many moms make the decision to wean with mixed emotions. Weaning brings more freedom and flexibility, and the proud realization that a child is reaching a milestone. But nursing is an intimate activity that fosters a strong bond between mother and child — and some women find it hard to let that go.

So expect a wide range of emotions, and understand that your child may have them too. Also remember that there will be countless other ways to nurture your child in the days ahead.",kidshealth.org

Now sure how to get started? These tips can help.

1. Talk with your doctor. Almost anyone, at any age, can exercise safely. If you're concerned about starting an exercise routine, talk with your doctor. Ask whether there are activities you should avoid and whether any health conditions you have might affect what exercises you can do safely.

2. Start gradually. Begin with low-intensity exercises like walking. Be sure to drink plenty of water before, during, and after your workout.

3. Develop a well-rounded routine. Include the four main types of exercise:

Endurance exercises increase your breathing and heart rate. Brisk walking is a good option.

Strength exercises, like lifting weights or using a resistance band, make your muscles stronger.

Balance exercises can help prevent falls. This includes standing on one foot.

Flexibility exercises, like yoga, stretch your muscles and help you stay limber and maintain mobility as you age.

330,Measuring Blood Pressure,"What do the results mean?

Your results, also known as a blood pressure reading, will contain two numbers. The top or first number is the systolic pressure. The bottom or second number is the diastolic pressure. High blood pressure readings are also labeled by categories, ranging from normal to crisis. Your reading may show your blood pressure is:

Blood Pressure Category Systolic Blood Pressure

Diastolic Blood Pressure Normal Less than 120 and Less than 80 High Blood Pressure (no other heart risk factors) 140 or higher or 90 or higher High Blood Pressure (with other heart risk factors, according to some providers) 130 or higher or 80 or higher Dangerously high blood pressure - seek medical care right away 180 or higher and 120 or higher

If you've been diagnosed with high blood pressure, your provider may recommend lifestyle changes and/or medicines to control your blood pressure. Your provider may also recommend that you regularly check your blood pressure at home with an automated blood pressure monitor. An at-home blood pressure monitor usually includes a blood pressure cuff and a digital device to record and display blood pressure readings.

Home monitoring is not a replacement for regular visits to your provider. But it can provide important information, such as whether treatment is working or your condition may have worsened. Also, home monitoring may make the test less stressful. Many people get nervous about getting their blood pressure taken at a provider's office. This is called ""white coat syndrome."" It can cause a temporary rise in blood pressure, making the results less accurate. For more information about home monitoring of blood pressure, talk to your provider.

335,Pregnancy Check-Ups: Healthy Start for Mom and Baby,"Pregnancy Check-Ups

Healthy Start for Mom and Baby

Life is busy before a baby arrives. There are many things to do to prepare. One of the most important is to visit your health care provider regularly.

Check-ups before your baby is born are called prenatal visits. They help make sure you and your baby are healthy. Your health care provider will look for certain problems that can happen during pregnancy. Some issues are best treated early. Others can be prevented before they start.

“Prenatal care is fundamental for shaping the lives of women and their children,” says Dr. Monica Longo, an NIH expert on prenatal health. Longo cares for women with high-risk pregnancies. Such women have a higher chance of complications.

If you think you may be pregnant, schedule a visit with your provider. If you’re pregnant, you’ll need to start regular prenatal visits. Most women have check-ups about once a month in the beginning. Then, they go more often later in the pregnancy.

During a prenatal visit, your provider will ask about your health history. They will also perform a physical exam and weight check. They’ll let you know how much weight gain is healthy for your body and help track your progress.

You’ll also be asked to provide a urine sample. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common during pregnancy. UTIs and other infections increase the risk of having a preterm birth. This is when you give birth at 37 weeks or earlier.

“One of the primary purposes of prenatal care is actually prevention,” says Longo. “We screen women to find potential health problems before those issues can worsen.”

During certain stages of pregnancy, your provider will perform blood tests and imaging tests. These include ultrasound exams to look at the baby’s growth and development. Visits are also an opportunity to talk with your provider about how to give your baby a healthy start.

“During prenatal visits, we educ-ate and counsel moms about healthy habits, healthy food choices, and exercise,” Longo says. “We also address any concerns a new mom-to-be might have.”

Taking a prenatal vitamin is also key. Folic acid is included in most prenatal vitamins. It reduces the risk of severe birth defects that affect the developing brain and spine.

It’s important to stay away from things that could harm your baby. These include certain medications, smoking, and alcoholic drinks. Also, talk with your provider about any health conditions. Conditions like diabetes (a disease that causes high blood sugar) and high blood pressure need to be brought under control.

Some women choose to talk with their provider before becoming pregnant. This is called a preconception visit. It can help you plan for a safer pregnancy.

Early and regular care for you and your developing baby is important. Studies show that prenatal care reduces the risk of having a low-birth weight baby. Low birth weight can cause health problems. Even during the pandemic, it’s essential to keep up with regular prenatal care.

“Providers around the globe have adapted prenatal care to fit the current challenges,” says Longo. That means using telehealth for visits that don’t have to be done in person.

Health care providers are also seeing fewer patients and extending the time between them. This reduces possible exposure in waiting rooms.

“Providers are prepared for these difficult times,” says Longo. So it’s crucial that moms-to-be keep up with prenatal care.",newsinhealth.nih.gov
336,Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP),"What is a basic metabolic panel (BMP)?

A basic metabolic panel (BMP) is a test that measures eight different substances in your blood. It provides important information about your body's chemical balance and metabolism. Metabolism is the process of how the body uses food and energy. A BMP includes tests for the following:

Glucose , a type of sugar and your body's main source of energy.

337,How to Prepare Your Child for a Lab Test,"What happens to my child during a lab test?

Common lab tests for children include blood tests, urine tests, swab tests, and throat cultures.

Blood tests are used to test for many different diseases and conditions. During a blood test, a sample will be taken from a vein in the arm, a fingertip, or a heel.

If done on a vein , a health care professional will take a sample, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial.

, a health care professional will take a sample, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. A fingertip blood test is done by pricking your child's fingertip.

test is done by pricking your child's fingertip. Heel stick tests are used for newborn screenings, a test given shortly after birth to almost every baby born in the United States. Newborn screenings are used to help diagnose a variety of serious health conditions. During a heel stick test, a health care provider will clean your baby's heel with alcohol and poke the heel with a small needle.

During a blood test, encourage your child to look at you, rather than at the person drawing the blood. You should also provide physical comfort and distraction.

Urine tests are done to check for different diseases and for infections of the urinary tract. During a urine test, your child will need to provide a urine sample in a special cup. Unless your child has an infection or a rash, a urine test is not painful. But it can be stressful. The following tips may help.

Talk to your child's provider to find out if a ""clean catch"" method will be needed. For a clean catch urine sample, your child will need to: Clean their genital area with a cleansing pad Start to urinate into the toilet Move the collection container under the urine stream Collect at least an ounce or two of urine into the container, which should have markings to indicate the amounts Finish urinating into the toilet

If a clean catch sample is needed, practice at home. Ask your child to let out a bit of urine in the toilet, stop the flow, and start again.

Encourage your child to drink water before the appointment, but not go to the bathroom. This may make it easier to urinate when it's time to collect the sample.

Turn on the tap. The sound of running water can help your child begin to urinate.

Swab tests help diagnose different types of respiratory infections. During a swab test, a health care provider will:

Gently insert a cotton-tipped swab inside your child's nostril. For some swab tests, a provider may need to insert the swab deeper, until the reaches the uppermost part of the nose and throat, known as the nasopharynx.

Rotate the swab and leave it in place for 10-15 seconds.

Remove the swab and insert into the other nostril.

Swab the second nostril using the same technique.

Swab tests may tickle the throat or cause your child to cough. A swab of the nasopharynx may be uncomfortable and cause a gag reflex when the swab touches the throat. Let your child know beforehand that gagging may happen, but it will be over quickly. It may also help to tell your child that the swab is similar to the cotton swabs you have at home.

Throat cultures are done to check for bacterial infections of the throat, including strep throat. During a throat culture:

Your child will be asked to tilt their head back and open their mouth as wide as possible.

Your child's provider will use a tongue depressor to hold down your child's tongue.

The provider will use a special swab to take a sample from the back of the throat and tonsils.

A throat swab isn't painful, but like some swab tests, it can cause gagging. Let your child know what to expect and that any discomfort shouldn't last very long.",medlineplus.gov
338,How to Cope with Medical Test Anxiety,"What is medical test anxiety?

Medical test anxiety is a fear of medical tests. Medical tests are procedures that are used to diagnose, screen for, or monitor various diseases and conditions. While many people sometimes feel nervous or uncomfortable about testing, it doesn't usually cause serious problems or symptoms.

Medical test anxiety can be serious. It can become a type of phobia. A phobia is an anxiety disorder that causes an intense, irrational fear of something that poses little or no actual danger. Phobias can also cause physical symptoms such as rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, and trembling.",medlineplus.gov
339,What You Need to Know About Blood Testing,"What happens during a blood test?

A health care provider will need to take a sample of your blood. This is also called a blood draw. When a blood draw is taken from a vein, it's known as venipuncture.

During venipuncture, a lab professional, known as a phlebotomist, will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.

Venipuncture is the most common way to do a blood test.

Other ways to do a blood test are:",medlineplus.gov
340,How to Prepare for a Lab Test,"How do I prepare for a lab test?

A laboratory (lab) test is a procedure in which a health care provider takes a sample of your blood, urine, other body fluid, or body tissue to get information about your health. Lab tests are often used to help diagnose or screen for a specific disease or condition. Screening helps diagnose diseases before symptoms occur. Other tests are used to monitor a disease or see if treatment is effective. Lab tests may also be done to provide more general information about your organs and body systems.

For any type of lab test, you should prepare for it by:

Following all the instructions given to you by your health care provider

Telling your provider or lab professional if you didn't follow these instructions exactly. It's important to be honest. Even a minor change from the instructions can have a big effect on your results. For example, some medicines raise or lower blood sugar levels. Taking them too close to a blood sugar test could affect your results.

Telling your provider about any medicines, vitamins, or supplements that you are taking

Taking these steps can help ensure your results will be accurate and reliable.",medlineplus.gov
341,Measuring Blood Pressure,"What do the results mean?

Your results, also known as a blood pressure reading, will contain two numbers. The top or first number is the systolic pressure. The bottom or second number is the diastolic pressure. High blood pressure readings are also labeled by categories, ranging from normal to crisis. Your reading may show your blood pressure is:

Blood Pressure Category Systolic Blood Pressure

Diastolic Blood Pressure Normal Less than 120 and Less than 80 High Blood Pressure (no other heart risk factors) 140 or higher or 90 or higher High Blood Pressure (with other heart risk factors, according to some providers) 130 or higher or 80 or higher Dangerously high blood pressure - seek medical care right away 180 or higher and 120 or higher

If you've been diagnosed with high blood pressure, your provider may recommend lifestyle changes and/or medicines to control your blood pressure. Your provider may also recommend that you regularly check your blood pressure at home with an automated blood pressure monitor. An at-home blood pressure monitor usually includes a blood pressure cuff and a digital device to record and display blood pressure readings.

Home monitoring is not a replacement for regular visits to your provider. But it can provide important information, such as whether treatment is working or your condition may have worsened. Also, home monitoring may make the test less stressful. Many people get nervous about getting their blood pressure taken at a provider's office. This is called ""white coat syndrome."" It can cause a temporary rise in blood pressure, making the results less accurate. For more information about home monitoring of blood pressure, talk to your provider.

If you were tested for low blood pressure, a blood pressure reading of 90 systolic, 60 diastolic (90/60) or lower is considered abnormal. Treatments for low blood pressure may include medicines and making certain changes to your diet.",medlineplus.gov

Antibiotics are medicines used to fight bacterial infections. There are different types of antibiotics. Each type is only effective against certain bacteria. An antibiotic sensitivity test can help find out which antibiotic will be most effective in treating your infection.

The test can also be helpful in finding a treatment for antibiotic-resistant infections. Antibiotic resistance happens when standard antibiotics become less effective or ineffective against certain bacteria. Antibiotic resistance can turn once easily treatable diseases into serious, even life-threatening illnesses.

343,When to Give Kids Medicine for Coughs and Colds,"Español

Although most colds in children don’t cause serious complications, they can cause anxiety in parents and caregivers. And colds are among the top reasons children visit a doctor. Both non-prescription (over-the-counter) and prescription medicines are available to treat cough and cold symptoms. But most children will get better on their own and may not need medicine.

Some cough and cold medicines also have serious side effects, such as slowed breathing, which can be life-threatening, especially in infants and young children, so it’s important to know when your child needs medication and when they can do without it.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration wants you to be aware of the following information about use of medicines for cough and colds in children:

The FDA doesn’t recommend over-the-counter (OTC) medicines for cough and cold symptoms in children younger than 2 years old.

Prescription cough medicines containing codeine or hydrocodone are not indicated for use in children younger than 18 years old. Codeine and hydrocodone are opioids that are available in combination with other medicines, such as antihistamines and decongestants, in prescription medicines to treat cough and symptoms associated with allergies or the common cold for adults.

Caregivers should also read labels on OTC cough and cold products, because some might contain codeine.

Here are some other tips on how to safely treat your child’s cough and cold.

Relieving Cold and Cough Symptoms

There’s no cure for the common cold, a viral infection that can’t be treated with antibiotics. Typically, a cold will run its course in a week or two, and children will usually get better on their own, without medication. For older children, some non-prescription medicines can help relieve the symptoms of a cold—but won’t change the natural course of the cold or make it go away faster.

Coughs are a normal symptom of a cold and help the body clear the mucus out of the airway and protect the lungs. Non-drug treatments for coughs include drinking plenty of fluids, especially warm drinks to soothe the throat.

When to Call a Doctor

Not every sniffle or cough merits a trip to the doctor’s office. When in doubt, parents should call their health care provider.

For all children, call a doctor if you see any of these symptoms:

A fever in an infant 2 months or younger

A fever of 102 degrees or higher at any age

Blue lips

Labored breathing, including nostrils widening with each breath, wheezing, fast breathing, the ribs showing with each breath or shortness of breath

Not eating or drinking, with signs of dehydration (such as decreased urination)

Excessive crankiness or sleepiness

Persistent ear pain

If the cough lasts for more than three weeks

If the child is getting worse

These symptoms can signal that your child may have something more serious than a cold.

What to Do About Fever and Other Symptoms Associated With a Cold

Fever helps the body fight off an infection and does not always need to be treated. But if your child is uncomfortable because of fever or other symptoms of a cold, there are alternatives to cough and cold medicine to help them feel more comfortable. They include:

A clean cool-mist vaporizer or humidifier in a small area near the child’s bed can help moisten the air and decrease the drying of the nasal passages and throat.

For infants with a stuffy nose, use saline or saltwater drops/spray to moisten nasal passages and loosen mucus. Then clean the nose with a bulb syringe or other suction tool designed for infants.

Acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help reduce fever, aches and pains. Take care to use the correct dose, consulting a health care provider for patients younger than age 2.

Giving the Right Dose of Medicine

How can you be sure to give the correct dose? Follow the directions on the “Drug Facts” label. The FDA encourages drug manufacturers to provide a dosing instrument, such as a syringe or a cup, marked with the correct measurements. Use them—and not household spoons or tools from other medications—to measure medication.

If you have questions, ask a pharmacist or your health care provider. They can tell you which dosing instrument to use, how much medication to give, and how often based on the Drug Facts label.

In the United States, adults average about three colds per year, and children have colds even more often. You might be tempted to give your children pain relievers, decongestants and other medications for a cold. But often it’s best to fight this common childhood illness with rest and care, using medications only when the symptoms are too uncomfortable or make it difficult for the patient to breathe or sleep.",www.fda.gov
344,How Radiation Therapy Is Used to Treat Cancer,"How Radiation Therapy Is Used to Treat Cancer

Radiation is one of the most common treatments for cancer. Other names for radiation treatment are radiation therapy, radiotherapy, irradiation, and x-ray therapy.

What is radiation therapy?

Radiation therapy uses high-energy particles or waves, such as x-rays, gamma rays, electron beams, or protons, to destroy or damage cancer cells.

Your cells normally grow and divide to form new cells. But cancer cells grow and divide faster than most normal cells. Radiation works by making small breaks in the DNA inside cells. These breaks keep cancer cells from growing and dividing and cause them to die. Nearby normal cells can also be affected by radiation, but most recover and go back to working the way they should.

While chemotherapy and other treatments that are taken by mouth or injection usually expose the whole body to cancer-fighting drugs, radiation therapy is usually a local treatment. This means it’s usually aimed at and affects only the part of the body needing treatment. Radiation treatments are planned so that they damage cancer cells with as little harm as possible to nearby healthy cells.

Some radiation treatments (systemic radiation therapy) use radioactive substances that are given in a vein or by mouth. Even though this type of radiation does travel throughout the body, the radioactive substance mostly collects in the area of the tumor, so there’s still little effect on the rest of the body.

Who gets radiation therapy?

More than half of people with cancer get radiation therapy. Sometimes, radiation therapy is the only cancer treatment needed and sometimes it's used with other types of treatment. The decision to use radiation therapy depends on the type and stage of cancer, and other health problems a patient might have.

What are the goals of radiation therapy?

Most types of radiation therapy don’t reach all parts of the body, which means they’re not helpful in treating cancer that has spread to many places within the body. Still, radiation therapy can be used to treat many types of cancer either alone or in combination with other treatments. While it's important to remember each cancer and each person is different, radiation is often the treatment of choice for the following purposes.

To cure or shrink early-stage cancer

Some cancers are very sensitive to radiation. Radiation may be used by itself in these cases to make the cancer shrink or completely go away. In some cases, chemotherapy or other anti-cancer drugs may be given first. For other cancers, radiation may be used before surgery to shrink the tumor (this is called pre-operative therapy or neoadjuvant therapy), or after surgery to help keep the cancer from coming back (called adjuvant therapy).

For certain cancers that can be cured either by radiation or by surgery, radiation may be the preferred treatment. This is because radiation can cause less damage and the part of the body involved may be more likely to work the way it should after treatment.

For some types of cancer, radiation and chemotherapy or other types of anti-cancer drugs might be used together. Certain drugs (called radiosensitizers) help radiation work better by making cancer cells more sensitive to radiation. Research has shown that when anti-cancer drugs and radiation are given together for certain types of cancer, they can help each other work even better than if they were given alone. One drawback, though, is that side effects are often worse when they are given together.

To stop cancer from coming back (recurring) somewhere else

Cancer can spread from where it started to other body parts. Doctors often assume that a few cancer cells might already have spread even when they can’t be seen on imaging scans like CT scans or MRIs. In some cases, the area where the cancer most often spreads to may be treated with radiation to kill any cancer cells before they grow into tumors. For instance, people with certain kinds of lung cancer may get radiation to the head, even when there is no cancer known to be there, because their type of lung cancer often spreads to the brain. This is done to help prevent cancer from spreading to the head even before it can. Sometimes, radiation to prevent future cancer can be given at the same time that radiation is given to treat existing cancer, especially if the area the cancer might spread to is close to the tumor itself.

To treat symptoms caused by advanced cancer

Sometimes cancer has spread too much to be cured. But some of these tumors can still be treated to make them smaller so that the person can feel better. Radiation might help relieve problems like pain, trouble swallowing or breathing, or bowel blockages that can be caused by advanced cancer. This is called palliative radiation.

To treat cancer that has returned (recurred)

If a person's cancer has returned (recurred), radiation might be used to treat the cancer or to treat symptoms caused by advanced cancer. Whether radiation will be used after recurrence depends on many factors. For instance, if the cancer has come back in a part of the body that has already been treated with radiation, it might not be possible to give more radiation in the same place. It depends on the amount of radiation that was used before. In other instances, radiation might be used in the same area of the body or a different area. Some tumors do not respond as well to radiation, so radiation might not be used even if they recur.

How is radiation therapy given?

Radiation therapy can be given in 3 ways:

External radiation (or external beam radiation) : uses a machine that directs high-energy rays from outside the body into the tumor. It’s done during outpatient visits to a hospital or treatment center. It's usually given over many weeks and sometimes will be given twice a day for several weeks. A person receiving external radiation is not radioactive and does not have to follow special safety precautions at home.

It's usually given over many weeks and sometimes will be given twice a day for several weeks. A person receiving external radiation is not radioactive and does not have to follow special safety precautions at home. Internal radiation: Internal radiation is also called brachytherapy. A radioactive source is put inside the body into or near the tumor. With some types of brachytherapy, radiation might be placed and left in the body to work. Sometimes it is placed in the body for a period of time and then removed. This is decided based on the type of cancer. Special safety precautions are needed for this type of radiation for a period of time. But it's important to know if the internal radiation is left in the body, after a while it eventually is no longer radioactive.

You might have to follow special precautions at home for a period of time after these drugs are given.

The type of radiation you might get depends on the kind of cancer you have and where it is. In some cases, more than one type is used. Your cancer care team can answer specific questions about the type of radiation prescribed for you, how it affects your body, and any precautions that may be needed.

Who gives radiation therapy treatments?

During your radiation therapy, a team of highly trained medical professionals will care for you. Your team may include these people:

Radiation oncologist: This doctor is specially trained to treat cancer with radiation. This person oversees your radiation treatment plan.

You may also need the services of a dietitian, physical therapist, social worker, dentist or dental oncologist, pharmacist, or other health care providers.

Does radiation therapy cause cancer?

It has long been known that radiation therapy can slightly raise the risk of getting another cancer. It’s one of the possible side effects of treatment that doctors have to think about when they weigh the benefits and risks of each treatment. For the most part, the risk of a second cancer from these treatments is small and is outweighed by the benefit of treating the cancer, but the risk is not zero. This is one of the many reasons each case is different and each person must be part of deciding which kind of treatment is right for them. The risk is different depending on where the radiation treatment will be in the body.

If your cancer care team recommends radiation treatment, it’s because they believe that the benefits you’ll get from it will outweigh the possible side effects. Still, this is your decision to make. Knowing as much as you can about the possible benefits and risks can help you be sure that radiation therapy is best for you.

Does radiation therapy affect pregnancy or fertility?

Females: It’s important not to become pregnant while getting radiation – it can harm the growing baby. If there’s a chance you might become pregnant, be sure to talk to your doctor about birth control options.

If you are or might be pregnant, let your doctor know right away.

If the area getting radiation in your body includes the ovaries, it is possible that the dose of radiation can cause the ovaries to no longer work (sterility), and that you would be unable to have children. it is important to know the risk of this possibility in advance of receiving radiation therapy. If you are thinking about radiation therapy that will affect the ovaries, talk to your doctor about how this might affect having children in the future.

Males: Not much is known about radiation’s effect on the children conceived by men while getting radiation therapy. Because of this, doctors often advise men to not get a woman pregnant during and for some weeks after treatment. Talk to your doctor to find out more about this.

If the area getting radiation includes the testicles, it is possible that the dose of radiation can cause the testicles to no longer work (sterility) and that you would be unable to have children. It is important to know the risk of this possibility in advance of receiving radiation therapy. There is no clear research about how sperm that is exposed to radiation affects future children made from that sperm. If you are thinking about radiation therapy that will affect the testicles, talk to your doctor about how this might affect having children in the future.

Sometimes cancer has spread too much to be cured. But some of these tumors can still be treated to make them smaller so that the person can feel better. Radiation might help relieve problems like pain, trouble swallowing or breathing, or bowel blockages that can be caused by advanced cancer. This is called palliative radiation.

To treat cancer that has returned (recurred)

If a person's cancer has returned (recurred), radiation might be used to treat the cancer or to treat symptoms caused by advanced cancer. Whether radiation will be used after recurrence depends on many factors. For instance, if the cancer has come back in a part of the body that has already been treated with radiation, it might not be possible to give more radiation in the same place. It depends on the amount of radiation that was used before. In other instances, radiation might be used in the same area of the body or a different area. Some tumors do not respond as well to radiation, so radiation might not be used even if they recur.

How is radiation therapy given?

Radiation therapy can be given in 3 ways:

External radiation (or external beam radiation) : uses a machine that directs high-energy rays from outside the body into the tumor. It’s done during outpatient visits to a hospital or treatment center. It's usually given over many weeks and sometimes will be given twice a day for several weeks. A person receiving external radiation is not radioactive and does not have to follow special safety precautions at home.

It's usually given over many weeks and sometimes will be given twice a day for several weeks. A person receiving external radiation is not radioactive and does not have to follow special safety precautions at home. Internal radiation: Internal radiation is also called brachytherapy. A radioactive source is put inside the body into or near the tumor. With some types of brachytherapy, radiation might be placed and left in the body to work. Sometimes it is placed in the body for a period of time and then removed. This is decided based on the type of cancer. Special safety precautions are needed for this type of radiation for a period of time. But it's important to know if the internal radiation is left in the body, after a while it eventually is no longer radioactive.

But it's important to know if the internal radiation is left in the body, after a while it eventually is no longer radioactive. Systemic radiation: Radioactive drugs given by mouth or put into a vein are used to treat certain types of cancer. These drugs then travel throughout the body. You might have to follow special precautions at home for a period of time after these drugs are given.

The type of radiation you might get depends on the kind of cancer you have and where it is. In some cases, more than one type is used. Your cancer care team can answer specific questions about the type of radiation prescribed for you, how it affects your body, and any precautions that may be needed.

Who gives radiation therapy treatments?

During your radiation therapy, a team of highly trained medical professionals will care for you. Your team may include these people:

Radiation oncologist: This doctor is specially trained to treat cancer with radiation. This person oversees your radiation treatment plan.

You may also need the services of a dietitian, physical therapist, social worker, dentist or dental oncologist, pharmacist, or other health care providers.

Does radiation therapy cause cancer?

It has long been known that radiation therapy can slightly raise the risk of getting another cancer. It’s one of the possible side effects of treatment that doctors have to think about when they weigh the benefits and risks of each treatment. For the most part, the risk of a second cancer from these treatments is small and is outweighed by the benefit of treating the cancer, but the risk is not zero. This is one of the many reasons each case is different and each person must be part of deciding which kind of treatment is right for them. The risk is different depending on where the radiation treatment will be in the body.

If your cancer care team recommends radiation treatment, it’s because they believe that the benefits you’ll get from it will outweigh the possible side effects. Still, this is your decision to make. Knowing as much as you can about the possible benefits and risks can help you be sure that radiation therapy is best for you.

Does radiation therapy affect pregnancy or fertility?

Females: It’s important not to become pregnant while getting radiation – it can harm the growing baby. If there’s a chance you might become pregnant, be sure to talk to your doctor about birth control options.

If you are or might be pregnant, let your doctor know right away.

If the area getting radiation in your body includes the ovaries, it is possible that the dose of radiation can cause the ovaries to no longer work (sterility), and that you would be unable to have children. it is important to know the risk of this possibility in advance of receiving radiation therapy. If you are thinking about radiation therapy that will affect the ovaries, talk to your doctor about how this might affect having children in the future.

Males: Not much is known about radiation’s effect on the children conceived by men while getting radiation therapy. Because of this, doctors often advise men to not get a woman pregnant during and for some weeks after treatment. Talk to your doctor to find out more about this.

If the area getting radiation includes the testicles, it is possible that the dose of radiation can cause the testicles to no longer work (sterility) and that you would be unable to have children. It is important to know the risk of this possibility in advance of receiving radiation therapy. There is no clear research about how sperm that is exposed to radiation affects future children made from that sperm. If you are thinking about radiation therapy that will affect the testicles, talk to your doctor about how this might affect having children in the future.

What Is a Gene Mutation?

A gene mutation (myoo-TAY-shun) is a change in one or more genes. Some mutations can lead to genetic disorders or illnesses.

What Are Genes?

Genes are short sections of DNA. They determine our traits, which are things like hair color, height, body type, and other things that make a person unique. Genes also play a role in a person's risk for some diseases and health conditions. Each of us has about 24,000 different types of genes.

What Is DNA?

DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is the carrier of all our genes. Each person gets one copy of DNA from their mother and one copy from their father. DNA creates a code using four chemicals called nucleotides (NEW-klee-uh-tydes). This code determines which genes a person has. DNA is located inside the chromosomes.

What Is a Chromosome?

A chromosome (KRO-muh-sohm) is an X-shaped thread-like structure in the body's cells. It contains DNA. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes.

What Causes a Gene Mutation?

A gene can mutate because of:

a change in one or more nucleotides of DNA

a change in many genes

loss of one or more genes

rearrangement of genes or whole chromosomes

Do Parents Pass Gene Mutations to Children?

If a parent carries a gene mutation in their egg or sperm, it can pass to their child. These hereditary (or inherited) mutations are in almost every cell of the person's body throughout their life. Hereditary mutations include cystic fibrosis, hemophilia, and sickle cell disease.

Other mutations can happen on their own during a person's life. These are called sporadic, spontaneous, or new mutations. They affect only some cells. Damage from the sun's ultraviolet radiation or exposure to some types of chemicals can lead to new mutations. These mutations are not passed from parents to their children.

Do All Gene Mutations Cause Health Problems?

Most gene mutations have no effect on health. And the body can repair many mutations. Some mutations are even helpful. For example, people can have a mutation that protects them from heart disease or gives them harder bones.",kidshealth.org

Antibiotics are medicines used to fight bacterial infections. There are different types of antibiotics. Each type is only effective against certain bacteria. An antibiotic sensitivity test can help find out which antibiotic will be most effective in treating your infection.

The test can also be helpful in finding a treatment for antibiotic-resistant infections. Antibiotic resistance happens when standard antibiotics become less effective or ineffective against certain bacteria. Antibiotic resistance can turn once easily treatable diseases into serious, even life-threatening illnesses.

351,Study of Mosquito Protein Could Lead to Treatments Against Life Threatening Viruses,"Study of mosquito protein could lead to treatments against life-threatening viruses

NIAID

The mosquito protein AEG12 strongly inhibits the family of viruses that cause yellow fever, dengue, West Nile, and Zika and weakly inhibits coronaviruses, according to scientists at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and their collaborators. The researchers found that AEG12 works by destabilizing the viral envelope, breaking its protective covering. Although the protein does not affect viruses that do not have an envelope, such as those that cause pink eye and bladder infections, the findings could lead to therapeutics against viruses that affect millions of people around the world. The research was published online in PNAS.

Scientists at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), part of NIH, used X-ray crystallography to solve the structure of AEG12. Senior author Geoffrey Mueller, Ph.D., head of the NIEHS Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Group, said at the molecular level, AEG12 rips out the lipids, or the fat-like portions of the membrane that hold the virus together.

""It is as if AEG12 is hungry for the lipids that are in the virus membrane, so it gets rid of some of the lipids it has and exchanges them for the ones it really prefers,"" Mueller said. ""The protein has high affinity for viral lipids and steals them from the virus.""

As a result, Mueller says the AEG12 protein has great killing power over some viruses. While the researchers demonstrated that AEG12 was most effective against flaviviruses, the family of viruses to which Zika, West Nile, and others belong, it is possible AEG12 could be effective against SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. But, Mueller said it will take years of bioengineering to make AEG12 a viable therapy for COVID-19. Part of the problem is AEG12 also breaks opens red blood cells, so researchers will have to identify compounds that will make the protein target viruses only.

Alexander Foo, Ph.D., an NIEHS visiting fellow and lead author of the paper, explained that mosquitoes produce AEG12 when they take a blood meal or become infected with flaviviruses. Like humans, mosquitoes mount a vigorous immune response against these viruses, with AEG12 bursting their viral covering. But, at the beginning of the project, Foo and his colleagues knew little about the function of AEG12.

""The prospect of studying a new protein is exciting, yet daunting,"" Foo said. ""Thankfully, we had enough clues and access to a wide range of expertise at NIEHS to piece it together.""

Co-author and crystallography expert Lars Pedersen, Ph.D., is leader of the NIEHS Structure Function Group. He routinely uses information about a molecule’s physical makeup in his work and encourages more scientists to consider using this data in their studies. He said, ""Our research shows that understanding the structure of a protein can be important in figuring out what it does and how it could help treat disease.""

352,Vaccine Safety: MedlinePlus Health Topic,"Summary

What are vaccines?

Vaccines play an important role in keeping us healthy. They protect us from serious and sometimes deadly diseases. Vaccines are injections (shots), liquids, pills, or nasal sprays that you take to teach your body's immune system to recognize and defend against harmful germs. The germs could be viruses or bacteria.

Some types of vaccines contain germs that cause disease. But the germs have been killed or weakened enough that they won't make you sick. Some vaccines only contain a part of a germ. Other types of vaccines include instructions for your cells to make a protein of the germ.

These different vaccine types all spark an immune response, which helps your body fight off the germs. Your immune system will also remember the germ and attack it if that germ ever invades again. This protection against a certain disease is called immunity.

These diseases can be very serious. Because of this, getting immunity from a vaccine is safer than getting immunity by being sick with the disease. And for a few vaccines, getting vaccinated can actually give you a better immune response than getting the disease would.

Do vaccines cause side effects?

As with medicines, any vaccine can cause side effects. Most of the time the side effects are minor, such as a sore arm, fatigue, or mild fever. They usually go away within a few days. These common side effects are often a sign that your body is starting to build immunity against a disease.

Serious side effects from vaccines can happen, but they are very rare. These side effects could include a severe allergic reaction. Other possible side effects are different for each vaccine. Talk with your health care provider if you're concerned about your health after getting vaccinated.

Some people worry that childhood vaccines could cause autism spectrum disorder (ASD). But many scientific studies have looked at this and have found no link between vaccines and ASD.

How are vaccines tested for safety?

Every vaccine that is approved in the United States goes through extensive safety testing. It starts with testing and evaluation of the vaccine before it's approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This process can often take several years.

First, the vaccine is tested in labs. Based on those tests, the FDA decides whether to test the vaccine with people.

Testing with people is done through clinical trials. In these trials, the vaccines are tested on volunteers. Clinical trials usually start with 20 to 100 volunteers, but eventually include thousands of volunteers.

The clinical trials have three phases. The trials are looking for the answer to important questions such as Is the vaccine safe? What dose (amount) works best? How does the immune system react to it? How effective is it?

During the process, the FDA works closely with the company who makes the vaccine to evaluate the vaccine's safety and effectiveness. If the vaccine is found to be safe and effective, it will be approved and licensed by the FDA.

After a vaccine is licensed, experts may consider adding it to the recommended vaccine, or immunization, schedule. This schedule is from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It lists which vaccines are recommended for different groups of people. They list which age groups should get which vaccines, how many doses they need, and when they should get them.

Testing and monitoring continue after the vaccine is approved:

The company making the vaccines tests every batch of vaccines for quality and safety. The FDA reviews the results of these tests. It also inspects the factories where the vaccine is made. These checks help make sure the vaccines meet standards for quality and safety.

The FDA, CDC, and other federal agencies continue to monitor its safety, to watch for possible side effects. They have systems to track any safety issues with the vaccines.

These high safety standards and testing help to make sure that vaccines in the United States are safe. Vaccines help protect against serious, even deadly, diseases. They not only protect you, but also help to keep these diseases from spreading to others.",medlineplus.gov
353,Why You Should Not Use Ivermectin to Treat or Prevent COVID-19,"Image

Español Português 中文 Tagalog Tiếng Việt 한국어

COVID-19. We’ve been living with it for what sometimes seems like forever. Given the number of deaths that have occurred from the disease, it’s perhaps not surprising that some consumers are looking at unconventional treatments, not approved or authorized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Though this is understandable, please beware. The FDA’s job is to carefully evaluate the scientific data on a drug to be sure that it is both safe and effective for a particular use, and then to decide whether or not to approve it. Using any treatment for COVID-19 that’s not approved or authorized by the FDA, unless part of a clinical trial, can cause serious harm.

There seems to be a growing interest in a drug called ivermectin to treat humans with COVID-19. Ivermectin is often used in the U.S. to treat or prevent parasites in animals. The FDA has received multiple reports of patients who have required medical support and been hospitalized after self-medicating with ivermectin intended for horses.

Here’s What You Need to Know about Ivermectin

FDA has not approved ivermectin for use in treating or preventing COVID-19 in humans. Ivermectin tablets are approved at very specific doses for some parasitic worms, and there are topical (on the skin) formulations for head lice and skin conditions like rosacea. Ivermectin is not an anti-viral (a drug for treating viruses).

Taking large doses of this drug is dangerous and can cause serious harm.

If you have a prescription for ivermectin for an FDA-approved use, get it from a legitimate source and take it exactly as prescribed.

Never use medications intended for animals on yourself. Ivermectin preparations for animals are very different from those approved for humans.

What is Ivermectin and How is it Used?

Ivermectin tablets are approved by the FDA to treat people with intestinal strongyloidiasis and onchocerciasis, two conditions caused by parasitic worms. In addition, some topical (on the skin) forms of ivermectin are approved to treat external parasites like head lice and for skin conditions such as rosacea.

Some forms of ivermectin are used in animals to prevent heartworm disease and certain internal and external parasites. It’s important to note that these products are different from the ones for people, and safe when used as prescribed for animals, only.

When Can Taking Ivermectin Be Unsafe?

The FDA has not reviewed data to support use of ivermectin in COVID-19 patients to treat or to prevent COVID-19; however, some initial research is underway. Taking a drug for an unapproved use can be very dangerous. This is true of ivermectin, too.

There’s a lot of misinformation around, and you may have heard that it’s okay to take large doses of ivermectin. That is wrong.

Even the levels of ivermectin for approved uses can interact with other medications, like blood-thinners. You can also overdose on ivermectin, which can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hypotension (low blood pressure), allergic reactions (itching and hives), dizziness, ataxia (problems with balance), seizures, coma and even death.

Ivermectin Products for Animals Are Different from Ivermectin Products for People

For one thing, animal drugs are often highly concentrated because they are used for large animals like horses and cows, which can weigh a lot more than we do—a ton or more. Such high doses can be highly toxic in humans.

Moreover, FDA reviews drugs not just for safety and effectiveness of the active ingredients, but also for the inactive ingredients. Many inactive ingredients found in animal products aren’t evaluated for use in people. Or they are included in much greater quantity than those used in people. In some cases, we don’t know how those inactive ingredients will affect how ivermectin is absorbed in the human body.

Meanwhile, effective ways to limit the spread of COVID-19 continue to be to wear your mask, stay at least 6 feet from others who don’t live with you, wash hands frequently, and avoid crowds.

354,Antibodies Protect Against COVID-19 Reinfection,"Health Capsule

Antibodies Protect Against COVID-19 Reinfection

NIAID

After having COVID-19, most people’s bodies develop antibodies to help fight it off. These are special molecules made by the body’s disease defense system, the immune system. A study found that people with these antibodies were less likely to get COVID-19 again.

Researchers looked at more than 3 million people who had an antibody test for SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes COVID-19.

They found that about 11% of people had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. More than 88% had a negative test. And less than 1% of tests were inconclusive.

The scientists looked at who came down with COVID-19 after the test. They analyzed up to 30 days, 31–60 days, 61–90 days, and more than 90 days after.

About 3% to 4% of people with negative antibody tests got COVID-19 in each time period. But those who had antibodies were less likely to have COVID-19 as time went on. Only 0.3% of the people with antibodies had a positive COVID-19 test more than 90 days after. Those without antibodies were 10 times more likely to get the disease.

The findings suggest that people who have a positive result from an antibody test may be at lower risk for future infection with SARS-CoV-2.

NIH’s Dr. Lynn Penberthy, who led the research team, explains that more questions still need to be answered. “We are nevertheless encouraged by this early finding,” she says.",newsinhealth.nih.gov

356,Coronavirus and the Nervous System,"What is COVID-19?

Coronaviruses are common causes of usually mild to moderate upper respiratory tract illnesses like the common cold, with symptoms that may include runny nose, fever, sore throat, cough, or a general feeling of being ill. However, a new coronavirus called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged and spread to cause the COVID-19 pandemic.

COVID-19, which means Coronavirus disease 2019, is an infectious disease that can affect people of all ages in many ways. It is most dangerous when the virus spreads from the upper respiratory tract into the lungs to cause viral pneumonia and lung damage leading to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). When severe, this impairs the body’s ability to maintain critical levels of oxygen in the blood stream—which can cause multiple body systems to fail and can be fatal.

What do we know about the effects of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 on the nervous system?

Much of the research to date has focused on the acute infection and saving lives. These strategies have included preventing infection with vaccines, treating COVID-19 symptoms with medicines or antibodies, and reducing complications in infected individuals.

Research shows the many neurological symptoms of COVID-19 are likely a result of the body’s widespread immune response to infection rather than the virus directly infecting the brain or nervous system. In some people, the SARS-CoV-2 infection causes an overreactive response of the immune system which can also damage body systems. Changes in the immune system have been seen in studies of the cerebrospinal fluid, which bathes the brain, in people who have been infected by SARS-CoV-2. This includes the presence of antibodies—proteins made by the immune system to fight the virus—that may also react with the nervous system. Although still under intense investigation, there is no evidence of widespread viral infection in the brain. Scientists are still learning how the virus affects the brain and other organs in the long-term. Research is just beginning to focus on the role of autoimmune reactions and other changes that cause the set of symptoms that some people experience after their initial recovery. It is unknown if injury to the nervous system or other body organs cause lingering effects that will resolve over time, or whether COVID-19 infection sets up a more persistent or even chronic disorder.

top

What are the immediate (acute) effects of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 on the brain?

Most people infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus will have no or mild to moderate symptoms associated with the brain or nervous system. However, most hospitalized patients do have symptoms related to the brain or nervous system, most commonly including muscle aches, headaches, dizziness, and altered taste and smell. Some people with COVID-19 either initially have, or develop in the hospital, a dramatic state of confusion called delirium. Although rare, COVID-19 can cause seizures or major strokes. Muscular weakness, nerve injury, and pain syndromes are common in people who require intensive care during infections. There are also very rare reports of conditions that develop after SARS-CoV-2 infection, as they sometimes do with other types of infections. These disorders of inflammation in the nervous system include Guillain-Barré syndrome (which affects nerves), transverse myelitis (which affects the spinal cord), and acute necrotizing leukoencephalopathy (which affects the brain).

Bleeding in the brain, weakened blood vessels, and blood clots in acute infection

The SARS-CoV-2 virus attaches to a specific molecule (called a receptor) on the surface of cells in the body. This molecule is concentrated in the lung cells but is also present on certain cells that line blood vessels in the body. The infection causes some arteries and veins – including those in the brain – to become thin, weaken, and leak. Breaks in small blood vessels have caused bleeding in the brain (so-called microbleeds) in some people with COVID-19 infection. Studies in people who have died due to COVID-19 infection show leaky blood vessels in different areas of the brain that allow water and a host of other molecules as well as blood cells that are normally excluded from the brain to move from the blood stream into the brain. This leak, as well as the resulting inflammation around blood vessels, can cause multiple small areas of damage. COVID-19 also causes blood cells to clump and form clots in arteries and veins throughout the body. These blockages reduce or block the flow of blood, oxygen, and nutrients that cells need to function and can lead to a stroke or heart attack.

A stroke is a sudden interruption of continuous blood flow to the brain. A stroke occurs either when a blood vessel in the brain becomes blocked or narrowed or when a blood vessel bursts and spills blood into the brain. Strokes can damage brain cells and cause permanent disability. The blood clots and vascular (relating to the veins, capillaries, and arteries in the body) damage from COVID-19 can cause strokes even in young healthy adults who do not have the common risk factors for stroke.

COVID-19 can cause blood clots in other parts of the body, too. A blood clot in or near the heart can cause a heart attack. A heart attack or Inflammation in the heart, called myocarditis, can cause heart failure, and reduce the flow of blood to other parts of the body. A blood clot in the lungs can impair breathing and cause pain. Blood clots also can damage the kidneys and other organs.

Low levels of oxygen in the body (called hypoxia) can permanently damage the brain and other vital organs in the body. Some hospitalized individuals require artificial ventilation on respirators. To avoid chest movements that oppose use of the ventilator it may be necessary to temporarily “paralyze” the patient and use anesthetic drugs to put the individual to sleep. Some individuals with severe hypoxia require artificial means of bringing oxygen into their blood stream, a technique called extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Hypoxia combined with these intensive care unit measure generally cause cognitive disorders that show slow recovery.

Diagnostic imaging of some people who have had COVID-19 show changes in the brain’s white matter that contains the long nerve fibers, or “wires,” over which information flows from one brain region to another. These changes may be due to a lack of oxygen in the brain, the inflammatory immune system response to the virus, injury to blood vessels, or leaky blood vessels. This “diffuse white matter disease” might contribute to cognitive difficulties in people with COVID-19. Diffuse white matter disease is not uncommon in individuals requiring intensive hospital care but it not clear if it also occurs in those with mild to moderate severity of COVID-19 illness.

top

What is the typical recovery from COVID-19?

Fortunately, people who have mild to moderate symptoms typically recover in a few days or weeks. However, some people who have had only mild or moderate symptoms of COVID-19 continue to experience dysfunction of body systems—particularly in the lungs but also possibly affecting the liver, kidneys, heart, skin, and brain and nervous system—months after their infection. In rare cases, some individuals may develop new symptoms (called sequelae) that stem from but were not present at the time of initial infection. People who require intensive care for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, regardless of the cause, usually have a long period of recovery. Individuals with long-term effects, whether following mild or more severe COVID-19, have in some cases self-identified as having “long COVID” or “long haul COVID.” These long-term symptoms are included in the scientific term, P ost A cute S equelae of SARS- C oV-2 Infection (PASC).

top

What are possible long-term neurological complications of COVID-19?

Researchers are following some known acute effects of the virus to determine their relationship to the post-acute complications of COVID-19 infection. These post-acute effects usually include fatigue in combination with a series of other symptoms. These may include trouble with concentration and memory, sleep disorders, fluctuating heart rate and alternating sense of feeling hot or cold, cough, shortness of breath, problems with sleep, inability to exercise to previous normal levels, feeling sick for a day or two after exercising (post-exertional malaise), and pain in muscle, joints, and chest. It is not yet known how the infection leads to these persistent symptoms and why in some individuals and not others.

Nerve damage, including peripheral neuropathy

Some symptoms experienced by some people weeks to months after COVID infection suggest the peripheral nervous system, the vast communication network that sends signals between the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord) and all other parts of the body, is impaired. Peripheral nerves send many types of sensory information to the central nervous system (CNS), such as a message that the feet are cold. They also carry signals from the CNS to the rest of the body, including those that control voluntary movement. Nerve dysfunction is also a known complication in those with critical care illness such as the acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Symptoms of peripheral neuropathy vary depending on the type of nerves – motor, sensory, or autonomic – that are damaged.

Motor nerves control the movement of all muscles under conscious control, such as those used for walking, grasping things, or talking. Damage to the motor nerves can cause muscle weakness and cramps.

control the movement of all muscles under conscious control, such as those used for walking, grasping things, or talking. Damage to the motor nerves can cause muscle weakness and cramps.

carry messages from our sense of touch, sight, hearing, taste, and smell. Sensory nerves transmit information such as the feeling of a light touch, temperature, or pain. The symptoms of sensory nerve damage can include loss of sense of touch, temperature, and pain or a tingling sensation. Autonomic nerves control organs to regulate activities that people do not control consciously, such as breathing, digestion, and heart and gland functions. Common symptoms include excess or absence of sweating, heat intolerance, and drop in blood pressure upon standing. Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (also known as POTS) can increase heart rate when standing up and cause such symptoms as lightheadedness (or fainting) or difficulty concentrating.

Fatigue and post-exertional malaise.

The most common persistent symptom weeks and months after COVID-19 infection is fatigue. The fatigue is similar to what one experiences with many viral infections such as the flu. The sense of fatigue can be brought on by both physical and mental activity. Some people are unable to return to work or school after COVID-19 due to fatigue, while others find it extremely difficult to accomplish their normal level of activity. Tasks such as walking the dog or going shopping can cause extreme tiredness and fatigue; some people can’t carry out everyday activities without feeling pain or tiredness. COVID-related complications such as depressed heart, lung, or kidney function, poor sleep, or muscle deconditioning are known to cause fatigue and affect the ability to exercise. Fatigue is very common in most inflammatory conditions. The cause(s) of fatigue in many of those suffering weeks and months after COVID-19 is not known.

Post-exertional malaise (PEM) is a condition in which otherwise usual activities are followed by a period of very severe fatigue and sense of feeling sick. PEM can occur with a delay after the activity, but can last for days thereafter.

Cognitive impairment/altered mental state

People with severe acute COVID-19 illness may develop confusion, delirium, and a depressed level of consciousness. Those suffering from post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 frequently have difficulty concentrating and memory problems, sometimes called “brain fog.” This impairment is a common symptom in those with severe fatigue of any cause. A variety of immune, metabolic, or blood vessel abnormalities or drug effects can contribute to the dramatic effects on cognitive function in the acute infection. Whether these also underlie the problems experienced weeks or months after mild or moderate illness is not known.

Muscle, joint, and chest pain

Some people continue to report pain in a muscle or group of muscles (myalgia), aching joints, and fatigue after recovering from the initial course of the virus. Persistent muscle pain and chest pain is commonly reported by persons recovering from ARDS, but is now being reported by those who had a mild or moderate infectious illness. Some individuals also have a sense of shortness of breath despite testing normal on pulmonary function tests.

Prolonged/lingering loss of smell (anosmia) or taste

Some people who have had COVID-19 may lose their sense of taste or smell, or the sensation of flavor. The loss of sense of taste or smell is characteristic of COVID-19 because the SARS-CoV-2 virus infects the tissue that forms the lining in the nose. The virus has been found to target certain cells in the nose that support the nerve cells. Those nerve cells detect odors and send that information to the brain. Damage to these supporting cells can cause smell or taste loss that can continue for weeks or months as these cells repair themselves or are replaced by new cells. During the recovery period some odors may smell different - even sometimes unpleasant or foul - than people remeber prior to being infected.

Persistent fevers and chills

Some people who recover from their acute (short-term) infection continue to have on-and-off fever, along with chills and body ache. Some people have a high, prolonged fever after the infection is gone, which might contribute to the sense of fatigue. In some instances, people who recover from the initial infection may have temperature dysregulation, in which it’s difficult for the body to keep a normal temperature.

Prolonged respiratory effects and lung damage

COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory disease that can seriously affect the lungs during and after the infection. Some people with the disease have breathing difficulties and some require supplemental oxygen support or mechanical ventilation via a respirator. The disease also can damage the muscles that help us breathe. Lung injury can cause low blood oxygen and brain hypoxia, which occurs when the brain isn’t getting enough oxygen. This can lead to cognitive impairment, seizures, stroke, and permanent damage to the brain and other organs. Results from several studies show that, even in people who have had mild-to-moderate infection, the effects of COVID-19 can persist in the lungs for months. Some people develop pneumonia after their acute illness has passed. Several people need pulmonary (lung) rehabilitation to rebuild their lung function. Studies show several people who had the infection, particularly those who had a more severe course of illness, also develop scarring of the lung and permanent lung dysfunction.

Headaches

Headaches are often among the many symptoms that can accompany infection from the coronavirus. Some people continue to have mild to serious headaches sometimes for weeks after recovery. The sensation of pressure is different from a migraine, which may be brought on by stress. The headaches may be infrequent or occur chronically (some people report having daily headache).

Sleep disturbances

Some people with long-term neurological effects from the SARS-CoV-2 infection report having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep (insomnia), excessive daytime sleepiness (hypersomnia), unrefreshing sleep, and changes in sleep patterns. It may be difficult for some people to wake up and fall asleep at their regular times. Depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can negatively affect sleep. Sleep disorders can contribute to fatigue and cognitive troubles. Some people report an increase in pain, headache, and stress because of lack of sleep. Continued loss of sleep also negatively affects attention and mood. For more information about COVID-19’s effect on sleep (as well as on the respiratory system) and tips to improve sleep, see the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.

Anxiety, depression, and stress post-COVID

The outbreak of COVID-19 is stressful for many people. People respond to stress in different ways and it is normal to experience a range of emotions, including fear, anxiety, and grief. Being isolated from others during the infection, the real risk of death, and the stress of hospitalization and critical care can trigger post-traumatic stress disorder. In addition, given the contagious nature of COVID-19, the individual is often not the only affected person in the family or circle of friends, some of whom may even have died. Some people may develop a mood or anxiety disorder. For information on post-COVID stress and coping, see the National Institute of Mental Health’s resources at National Institute of Mental Health's (NIMH) Director, Dr. Gordon In the News and NIMH Shareable Resources on Coping with COVID-19.

How do the long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection/COVID-19 relate to Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS)?

Some of the symptom clusters reported by people still suffering months after their COVID-19 infection overlap with symptoms described by individuals with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). People with a diagnosis of ME/CFS have wide-ranging and debilitating effects including fatigue, PEM, unrefreshing sleep, cognitive difficulties, postural orthostatic tachycardia, and joint and muscle pain. Unfortunately, many people with ME/CFS do not return to pre-disease levels of activity. The cause of ME/CFS is unknown but many people report its onset after an infectious-like illness. Rest, conserving energy, and pacing activities are important to feeling better but don’t cure the disease. Although the long-term symptoms of COVID-19 may share features with it, ME/CFS is defined by symptom-based criteria and there are no tests that confirm an ME/CFS diagnosis.

ME/CFS is not diagnosed until the key features, especially severe fatigue, post-exertional malaise, and unrefreshing sleep, are present for greater than six months. It is now becoming more apparent that following infection with SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19, some individuals may continue to exhibit these symptoms beyond six months and qualify for an ME/CFS diagnosis. It is unknown how many people will develop ME/CFS after SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is possible that many individuals with ME/CFS, and other disorders impacting the nervous system, may benefit greatly if research on the long-term effects of COVID-19 uncovers the cause of debilitating symptoms including intense fatigue, problems with memory and concentration, and pain.

Am I at a higher risk if I currently have a neurological disorder?

Much is still unknown about the coronavirus but people having one of several underlying medical conditions may have an increased risk of illness. However, not everyone with an underlying condition will be at risk of developing severe illness. People who have a neurological disorder may want to discuss their concerns with their doctors.

Because COVID-19 is a new virus, there is little information on the risk of getting the infection in people who have a neurological disorder. People with any of these conditions might be at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19:

Cerebrovascular disease

Stroke

Obesity

Dementia

Diabetes

High blood pressure

There is evidence that COVID-19 seems to disproportionately affect some racial and ethnic populations, perhaps because of higher rates of pre-existing conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and lung disease. Social determinants of health (such as access to health care, poverty, education, ability to remain socially distant, and where people live and work) also contribute to increased health risk and outcomes.

top

Can COVID-19 cause other neurological disorders?

In some people, response to the coronavirus has been shown to increase the risk of stroke, dementia, muscle and nerve damage, encephalitis, and vascular disorders. Some researchers think the unbalanced immune system caused by reacting to the coronavirus may lead to autoimmune diseases, but it's too early to tell.

Anecdotal reports of other diseases and conditions that may be triggered by the immune system response to COVID-19 include para-infectious conditions that occur within days to a few weeks after infection:

Multi-system infammatory syndrome - which causes inflammation in the body's blood vessels

Transverse myelitis - an inflammation of the spinal cord

Guillain-Barré sydrome (sometimes known as acute polyradiculoneuritis) - a rare neurological disorder which can range from brief weakness to nearly devastating paralysis, leaving the person unable to breathe independently

Dysautonomia - dysfunction of the autonomic nerve system, which is involved with functions such a breathing, heart rate, and temperature control

Acute disseminating encephalomyelitis (ADEM) - an attack on the protective myelin covering of nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord

Acute necrotizing hemorrhagic encephalopathy - a rare type of brain disease that causes lesions in certain parts of the brain and bleeding (hemorrhage) that can cause tissue death (necrosis)

Facial nerve palsies (lack of function of a facial nerve) such as Bell's Palsy

Parkinson's disease-like symptoms have been reported in a few individuals who had no family history or early signs of the disease

Does the COVID-19 vaccine cause neurological problems?

Almost everyone should get the COVID-19 vaccination. It will help protect you from getting COVID-19. The vaccines are safe and effective and cannot give you the disease. Most side effects of the vaccine may feel like flu and are temporary and go away within a day or two. In early vaccine development, there were extremely rare reports of unexplained neurological illness following COVID-19 vaccination, but regulators found no evidence the vaccines caused the illness. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) continues to investigate any report of adverse consequences of the vaccine and none have appeared as of yet. Consult your primary care doctor or specialist if you have concerns regarding any pre-existing known allergic or other severe reactions and vaccine safety. Scientists are studying the risk to benefit ratio of the vaccine in someone who previously developed Guillain Barré syndrome after a vaccination. The general sense is the COVID-19 vaccine is safe in individuals whose Guillain-Barré syndrome was not associated with a previous vaccination.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) site offers information on vaccine resources at https://www.coronavirus.gov/. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has information on vaccines for the coronavirus. See: https://covid19.nih.gov/.

357,Long-Term Effects of COVID-19,"Types of Post-COVID Conditions

Long COVID

Long COVID is a range of symptoms that can last weeks or months after first being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 or can appear weeks after infection. Long COVID can happen to anyone who has had COVID-19, even if the illness was mild, or they had no symptoms. People with long COVID report experiencing different combinations of the following symptoms:

Tiredness or fatigue

Difficulty thinking or concentrating (sometimes referred to as “brain fog”)

Headache

Loss of smell or taste

Dizziness on standing

Fast-beating or pounding heart (also known as heart palpitations)

Chest pain

Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath

Cough

Joint or muscle pain

Depression or anxiety

Fever

Symptoms that get worse after physical or mental activities

Multiorgan Effects of COVID-19

Multiorgan effects can affect most, if not all, body systems including heart, lung, kidney, skin, and brain functions. Multiorgan effects can also include conditions that occur after COVID-19, like multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) and autoimmune conditions. MIS is a condition where different body parts can become swollen. Autoimmune conditions happen when your immune system attacks healthy cells in your body by mistake, causing painful swelling in the affected parts of the body.

It is unknown how long multiorgan system effects might last and whether the effects could lead to chronic health conditions.

Effects of COVID-19 Treatment or Hospitalization

Post-COVID conditions also can include the longer-term effects of COVID-19 treatment or hospitalization. Some of these longer-term effects are similar to those related to hospitalization for other respiratory infections or other conditions.

Effects of COVID-19 treatment and hospitalization can also include post-intensive care syndrome (PICS), which refers to health effects that remain after a critical illness. These effects can include severe weakness and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD involves long-term reactions to a very stressful event.",www.cdc.gov
358,Dr. Ben Cowling on Super Spreading of COVID-19,"Q&A

Dr. Ben Cowling on Super Spreading of COVID-19

Ben Cowling, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at the University of Hong Kong

Excerpts from our conversation with Dr. Ben Cowling, an NIH-funded epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong.

NIHNiH: What is “super spreading,” and how is it driving the COVID-19 pandemic?

Cowling: We looked at infections in Hong Kong. And what we found is that infections often occurred in clusters. So although on average, one person may have been infecting two others, actually, a lot of the cases didn’t infect anyone.

We found that 70% of cases didn’t affect anyone, didn’t transmit at all. And about 20% of cases were responsible for 80% of transmission. That’s called super-spreading.

NIHNiH: Has this pattern been seen before? Is it limited to Hong Kong?

Cowling: We observe that the minority of cases are responsible for a majority of transmission. It’s not the first time we've seen that happening. That happened for SARS (another coronavirus) in 2003. It happens for MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) coronavirus, as well. And now we think it happens for COVID.

Although our research is in Hong Kong, using Hong Kong data, actually the same kind of phenomenon has been reported elsewhere. And we believe it’s actually what’s happening a lot of the time with COVID in the U.S. as well.

NIHNiH: How does super spreading occur?

Cowling: You need to have a lot of people around a contagious case. If there’s a contagious person who isolates themselves once they worry they’re infected, there won’t be any superspreading because there won’t be an opportunity. You also need the case to be a relatively more contagious case. We’ve found that there’s a lot of variability in contagiousness.

One of the questions we still haven’t answered is: What makes a super-spreader? What is it about those people that makes them more contagious and more likely to transmit to lots of other people? We haven’t really identified it. Maybe there’s some genetic component. Maybe there’s some other factor related to age or social behavior.

NIHNiH: How can we reduce super spreading?

Cowling: If we can find ways to minimize the opportunity for super-spreading events, it would really help a lot. And so that means in the U.S., things like either making sure bars are closed or operating in reduced capacity or with better ventilation. Same for restaurants. Workplaces really need to think about not having a crowded cubicle area, where if there was one infected person in the middle that they could spread it to everyone. Public transport may need to be more careful, especially on public transport that has longer journeys.

NIHNiH: How will limiting super spreading help?

Cowling: If we can find ways to remove one of those ingredients for super-spreading events—and that’s the opportunity—then it can go a long way to reducing transmission. So that’s really, in my opinion, an important approach.

If we can reduce crowding, then we can actually do a lot of good without having to have drastic stay-at-home orders. We can still let people do some of the things they want to do.",newsinhealth.nih.gov

How Long Does Protection Last After COVID-19?

NIAID Integrated Research Facility, Fort Detrick, Maryland

After your body’s disease defense system (the immune system) fights off a virus, it keeps a memory of it. A study suggests that people’s immune systems remember COVID-19 for months after recovery.

The immune system makes different types of cells and molecules to fight disease. These include antibodies, T cells, and B cells.

Researchers looked at immune responses from about 200 people who’d recovered from COVID-19. Some had been infected up to eight months before the analysis. Other cases were more recent. Of the people who recovered, 95% had immune system “memories” of the virus that causes COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2.

Almost everyone had antibodies that block the virus’ spike protein. The virus uses this protein to enter cells. The number and type of antibodies varied between people. But the levels usually remained stable over time. They slightly decreased six to eight months after infection.

Immune cell levels also remained high. Memory B cells, which make antibodies, increased for a few months after infection and then remained stable. Most people had one important type of T cell. About half had another type of T cell that kills infected cells.

“Several months ago, our studies showed that natural infection induced a strong response, and this study now shows that the responses last,” says Dr. Daniela Weiskopf at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology. “We are hopeful that a similar pattern of responses lasting over time will also emerge for the vaccine-induced responses.”",newsinhealth.nih.gov
360,Understanding COVID-19: How To Protect Yourself During the Pandemic,"Understanding COVID-19

How To Protect Yourself During the Pandemic

COVID-19 has claimed millions of lives around the world. But we learn more about this disease every day. Scientists are developing tools that promise to slow and eventu­ally help us overcome the pandemic.

COVID-19 is caused by a new coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. There are many types of coronaviruses. Some cause the common cold. Others have led to fatal disease outbreaks. These include severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012, and now COVID-19.

Coronaviruses are named for the crown-like spikes on their surface. (Corona means crown.) The viruses use the spikes to help get inside your body’s cells. Once inside, they replicate, or make copies of themselves.

Scientists have learned how to turn these spikes against the virus through vaccines and treatments. They’ve also learned what you can do to protect yourself from the virus.

Protecting Yourself

You’re most likely to get COVID-19 through close contact with someone who’s infected. Coughing, sneezing, talking, and breathing produce small droplets of liquid. These are called respiratory droplets. They travel through the air and can be inhaled by someone else.

“COVID-19 is spread mainly through exposure to respiratory droplets that tend to drop within six feet,” says Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. That’s why it’s important to stay at least six feet (about two arm lengths) away from people who don’t live with you.

“Surfaces can be contaminated. But it is likely that this is a less common cause of infection rather than person-to-person directly,” Fauci says.

You can protect yourself and others by wearing a mask. Choose one that has at least two layers of fabric. Make sure that the mask covers your mouth and nose and doesn’t leak air around the edges.

“There’s very little transmission in places where masks are worn,” says Dr. Ben Cowling at the University of Hong Kong who studies how viruses spread. Cowling found that infections were most often spread in settings where masks aren’t worn.

“Masks work. But even with mandatory masking, you still need social distancing as well,” he says. You can lower your risk by avoiding crowds. Crowds increase the risk of coming in contact with someone who has COVID-19.

What to Look For

Common symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, headaches, fatigue, and muscle or body aches. People with COVID-19 may also lose their sense of smell or taste. Symptoms usually appear two to 14 days after being exposed to the virus.

But even people who don’t seem sick can still infect others. The CDC estimates that 50% of infections are spread by people with no symptoms. While some with this virus develop life-threatening illness, others have mild symptoms, and some never develop any.

Catching the virus is more dangerous for some groups of people. This includes older adults and people with certain medical conditions. These medical conditions include obesity, diabetes, heart and lung disease, and asthma. About 40% of Americans have at least one of these risk factors.

Getting Treatment

Better COVID-19 treatments mean that fewer people now get severely sick if they catch the virus. Scientists have been working to test available drugs against the virus. They’ve found at least two that can help people who are hospitalized with the virus.

A drug called remdesivir can reduce the time a patient spends in the hospital. A steroid called dexamethasone helps stop the immune systemThe system that protects your body from invading viruses, bacteria, and other microscopic threats. from reacting too strongly to the virus. That can damage body tissues and organs.

Antibody treatments are also available. Antibodies are proteins that your body makes to fight germs. Scientists have learned how to make them in the lab. Antibody treatments can block SARS-CoV-2 to prevent the illness from getting worse. They seem to have the most benefit when given early in the disease.

“Antibody treatments really do have the potential to help people, especially for treating individuals who are not yet hospitalized,” says Dr. Mark Heise, who studies the genetics of viruses at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Heise is working to develop mouse models to test treatments and vaccines.

Studies are now testing combinations of treatments. “Combining drugs that target both the virus and the person’s immune response may help treat COVID-19,” says Heise. Scientists are also looking for new drugs that better target the virus.

A Shot of Hope: Vaccines

It used to take a decade or more to develop a new vaccine. In this pandemic, scientists created COVID-19 vaccines in less than a year.

The first two vaccines approved for emergency use are from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech. Moderna’s vaccine was co-developed with NIH scientists. Both are a new type of vaccine called mRNA vaccines. mRNA carries the genetic information for your body to make proteins.

The vaccines direct the body’s cells to make a piece of the virus called the spike protein. These proteins can’t cause illness by themselves. But they teach your immune system to make antibodies against the protein. If you encounter the virus later, the antibodies provide protection against it.

The mRNA vaccines now available were shown to be more than 90% effective in large clinical trials. They can cause side effects—such as fatigue, muscle aches, joint pain, and headache. But both vaccines were found to be safe in the clinical trials.

“Get vaccinated. The vaccines are safe. They’re incredibly effective,” says Dr. Jason McLellan, an expert on coronaviruses at the University of Texas at Austin. McLellan’s research was critical in developing these vaccines. His team, along with NIH scientists, figured out how to lock the shape of the spike protein to make the most effective antibodies.

As the pandemic has gone on, new versions of the virus, or variants, have appeared. “We’re all very confident that vaccines will continue to work well against these variants,” McLellan says. “Vaccination also helps stop the development of new variants, because it provides fewer opportunities for the virus to change as it replicates.”

Many people will need to be vaccinated for the pandemic to end. Fauci estimates that 70% to 85% of the U.S. population will need to be vaccinated to get “herd immunity.” That’s the point where enough people are immune to the virus to prevent its spread. That’s important because it protects vulnerable people who can’t get vaccinated.

“It is my hope that all Americans will protect themselves by getting vaccinated when the vaccine becomes available to them,” Fauci says. “That is how our country will begin to heal and move forward.”",newsinhealth.nih.gov

362,FDA and CDC Lift Recommended Pause on Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) COVID-19 Vaccine Use Following Thorough Safety Review,"Following a thorough safety review, including two meetings of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have determined that the recommended pause regarding the use of the Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) COVID-19 Vaccine in the U.S. should be lifted and use of the vaccine should resume.

The pause was recommended after reports of six cases of a rare and severe type of blood clot in individuals following administration of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. During the pause, medical and scientific teams at the FDA and CDC examined available data to assess the risk of thrombosis involving the cerebral venous sinuses, or CVST (large blood vessels in the brain), and other sites in the body (including but not limited to the large blood vessels of the abdomen and the veins of the legs) along with thrombocytopenia, or low blood platelet counts. The teams at FDA and CDC also conducted extensive outreach to providers and clinicians to ensure they were made aware of the potential for these adverse events and could properly manage and recognize these events due to the unique treatment required for these blood clots and low platelets, also known as thrombosis-thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS).

The two agencies have determined the following:

Use of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine should be resumed in the United States.

The FDA and CDC have confidence that this vaccine is safe and effective in preventing COVID-19.

The FDA has determined that the available data show that the vaccine’s known and potential benefits outweigh its known and potential risks in individuals 18 years of age and older.

At this time, the available data suggest that the chance of TTS occurring is very low, but the FDA and CDC will remain vigilant in continuing to investigate this risk.

Health care providers administering the vaccine and vaccine recipients or caregivers should review the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers Administering Vaccine (Vaccination Providers) external icon and Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers external icon , which have been revised to include information about the risk of this syndrome, which has occurred in a very small number of people who have received the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine.

CDC’s independent Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices met today to discuss the latest data on TTS, hearing from the vaccine manufacturer Janssen and the COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Technical (VaST) Subgroup, as well as a risk benefit analysis. ACIP is committed to be vigilant and responsive to additional information that could impact the risk benefit analysis of any of these vaccines. Vaccine safety monitoring will continue and any new information about TTS will be brought to ACIP as needed.

“Safety is our top priority. This pause was an example of our extensive safety monitoring working as they were designed to work—identifying even these small number of cases. We’ve lifted the pause based on the FDA and CDC’s review of all available data and in consultation with medical experts and based on recommendations from the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. We have concluded that the known and potential benefits of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine outweigh its known and potential risks in individuals 18 years of age and older. We are confident that this vaccine continues to meet our standards for safety, effectiveness and quality. We recommend people with questions about which vaccine is right for them have those discussions with their health care provider,” said Janet Woodcock, M.D., Acting FDA Commissioner.

“Above all else, health and safety are at the forefront of our decisions,” said CDC Director Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky. “Our vaccine safety systems are working. We identified exceptionally rare events – out of millions of doses of the Janssen COVID-19 administered – and we paused to examine them more carefully. As we always do, we will continue to watch all signals closely as more Americans are vaccinated. I continue to be encouraged by the growing body of real-world evidence that the authorized COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective, and they protect people from disease, hospitalization, and death. I urge anyone with questions about the COVID-19 vaccines to speak with their healthcare provider or local public health department.”

Assessment of Available Data

Medical and scientific teams at the FDA and CDC reviewed several sources of information and data related to the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine to reach today’s decision.

Specifically, the agencies assessed reports submitted to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS),external icon reviewed the medical literature and considered the information from global regulatory partners about thrombosis with thrombocytopenia that have been reported following use of a similar, yet not identical, COVID-19 vaccine using a virus from the adenovirus family that has been modified to contain the gene for making a protein from SARS-CoV-2.

Update on Adverse Events

On April 13, the FDA and CDC announcedexternal icon that, out of more than 6.8 million doses administered, six reports of a rare and severe type of blood clot combined with low blood platelet levels occurring in people after receiving the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine had been reported to VAERS. In these cases, a type of blood clot called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) was seen in combination with low levels of blood platelets (thrombocytopenia).

Today, the agencies can confirm that a total of 15 cases of TTS have been reported to VAERS, including the original six reported cases. All of these cases occurred in women between the ages of 18 and 59, with a median age of 37 years. Reports indicated symptom onset between 6 and 15 days after vaccination.

Monitoring for Safety Will Continue

The surveillance systems that are in place to monitor the safety of COVID-19 vaccines authorized for emergency use are working, as demonstrated by both agencies’ quick work to identify and investigate these rare, but serious adverse events. The FDA and CDC will continue with these efforts to closely monitor the safety of these vaccines.

363,Recommendation to Pause Use of Johnson & Johnson's Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine,"Since use of COVID-19 vaccines began in the United States, scientists and doctors have constantly and carefully reviewed all reports of vaccine side effects and adverse events. As of April 23, 2021, more than 8 million doses of the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine had been given in the United States. As of April 23, 2021, experts reviewing safety reports for this vaccine found 15 reports of women who got the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine and later developed thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). TTS is a serious condition that involves blood clots with low platelets.

These reports suggest an increased risk of TTS one to two weeks after vaccination with the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. As of April 23, 2021, the reports reviewed all occurred in women between 18 and 59 years old, with a median of 37 years. These reports represent a reporting rate of 7 such events per 1 million vaccinations among women 18 through 49 years old and a rate of 0.9 per 1 million vaccinations among women 50 years and older. For all women, this is a rare adverse event. For women 50 years and older and men of all ages, the adverse event is even more rare. Reports show that symptoms of this adverse event started between 6 and 15 days after vaccination.",www.cdc.gov
364,What Are mRNA Vaccines and How Do They Work?,"Vaccines help prepare the body to fight foreign invaders (pathogens such as bacteria or viruses), to prevent infection. All vaccines introduce into the body a harmless piece of a particular bacteria or virus, triggering an immune response. Most vaccines contain a weakened or killed bacteria or virus. However, scientists have developed a new type of vaccine that uses a molecule called messenger RNA (or mRNA for short) rather than part of an actual bacteria or virus. Messenger RNA is a type of RNA that is necessary for protein production. In cells, mRNA uses the information in genes to create a blueprint for making proteins. Once cells finish making a protein, they quickly break down the mRNA. mRNA from vaccines does not enter the nucleus and does not alter DNA.

mRNA vaccines work by introducing a piece of mRNA that corresponds to a viral protein, usually a small piece of a protein found on the virus’s outer membrane. (Individuals who get an mRNA vaccine are not exposed to the virus, nor can they become infected by it.) Using this mRNA blueprint, cells produce the viral protein. As part of a normal immune response, the immune system recognizes that the protein is foreign and produces specialized proteins called antibodies. Antibodies help protect the body against infection by recognizing individual viruses or other pathogens, attaching to them, and marking the pathogens for destruction. Once produced, antibodies remain in the body, even after the body has rid itself of the pathogen, so that the immune system can quickly respond if exposed again. If a person is exposed to a virus after receiving mRNA vaccination for it, antibodies can quickly recognize it, attach to it, and mark it for destruction before it can cause serious illness.

Like all vaccines in the United States, mRNA vaccines require authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before they can be used. Currently vaccines for COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, are the only authorized mRNA vaccines. These vaccines use mRNA that directs cells to produce copies of a protein on the outside of the coronavirus known as the “spike protein”. Researchers are studying how mRNA might be used to develop vaccines for additional infectious diseases.",medlineplus.gov

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized three COVID-19 vaccines for emergency use. The vaccines are:

Emergency use authorization (EUA) allows these vaccines to be distributed in the U.S. Learn more about EUAs for COVID-19 vaccines from the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER).

Who authorizes COVID-19 vaccines for emergency use?

The FDA is the authority that has regulatory oversight of the safety, effectiveness and quality of vaccines that are used in the U.S., including COVID-19 vaccines. FDA employees who are career scientists and doctors are the people who decided to authorize COVID-19 vaccines after they thoroughly analyzed and evaluated the data on COVID-19 vaccine safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality.

The FDA may issue an EUA when the agency’s scientific experts have determined that the known and potential benefits of the vaccine outweigh its known and potential risks. FDA employees are fathers, mothers, daughters, sons, sisters, brothers and more. They and their families are directly impacted by the work they do.

Why should I get a COVID-19 vaccine?

When you get a COVID-19 vaccine, you are choosing to protect yourself and make a difference for your children, parents, grandparents, and other loved ones. Millions of people in the U.S. have already received a COVID-19 vaccine. For a community to be fully protected, most community members need to get the vaccine. Getting vaccinated to prevent COVID-19 will help protect you from COVID-19, and it may also protect the people around you.

How do I get a COVID-19 vaccine?

Go to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website to find your state and local health departments who are responsible for COVID-19 vaccine distribution. All questions and concerns should be sent to your state government or local health department. The U.S. government’s goal is to have enough COVID-19 vaccine doses for all people in the U.S. who choose to be vaccinated.

FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines are being distributed for free by states and local communities. If you see vaccines for sale online, or if someone asks you for money to get a vaccine appointment, to put your name on a waiting list, or to get access to a vaccine, it is a scam. You do not need to pay to get a vaccine appointment or to be put on a waiting list.

Do the COVID-19 vaccines work?

Yes. All three FDA-authorized vaccines are effective in preventing COVID-19 and related serious outcomes, including hospitalization and deaths. The FDA thoroughly evaluated and analyzed the safety and effectiveness data for all of the authorized COVID-19 vaccines and determined that the available data for each vaccine provides clear evidence that the known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks of each vaccine.

Do the COVID-19 vaccines work against the new variants?

The available information suggests that the authorized vaccines remain effective in protecting the American public against currently circulating strains of COVID-19. We are already talking with vaccine manufacturers about these new strains and how to quickly and safely make any changes that may be needed in the future.

Some variants spread more easily than others and are more transmissible than the original virus that causes COVID-19. To help slow the spread of COVID-19, get a COVID-19 vaccine when it is available to you. Other ways to slow the spread include:

Wearing a mask

Keeping 6 feet apart from others who don’t live with you

Avoiding crowds and poorly ventilated indoor spaces

Washing your hands often with soap and water (use hand sanitizer if soap and water aren’t available)

How safe are the COVID-19 vaccines?

The FDA evaluated data from clinical studies that included tens of thousands of people for each COVID-19 vaccine. The FDA authorized the vaccines because the data from these studies clearly showed that the known and potential benefits of the FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines outweighed the known and potential risks.



Report vaccine side effects toll-free at 1-800-822-7967 or online to FDA/CDC Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).

Millions of doses of FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines have been given to people all around the country. Serious adverse events following vaccination are very rare. Allergic reactions, some of which are severe, and cases of anaphylaxis have occurred following administration of COVID-19 vaccines. Anaphylaxis is a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction that happens within seconds or minutes of exposure to an allergen. Because of this remote chance of severe allergic reaction or anaphylaxis, health care providers may ask you to stay at the place where you received your COVID-19 vaccine for monitoring for 15 to 30 minutes.

For one vaccine, the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine, there have been cases reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) of a type of blood clot called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) in combination with low levels of platelets in the blood (thrombocytopenia). CVST occurs when a blood clot forms in the brain's venous sinuses. This prevents blood from draining out of the brain. It is a type of rare stroke.

On April 13, 2021, the FDA and CDC recommended a pause in the use of this vaccine out of an abundance of caution while it further investigates these cases and to ensure that the health care provider community is aware of the potential for these adverse events and can plan for proper recognition and management due to the unique treatment required with this type of blood clot.

Can I see the safety and effectiveness data that support the Emergency Use Authorization of the COVID-19 vaccines?

The FDA is publicly sharing information about COVID-19 vaccines so you can see the evidence for yourself. The FDA’s analysis of clinical trial data, as well as demographic information about the clinical study volunteers, is available in the FDA Briefing Document for each vaccine. You can also view the advisory committee webcasts where outside experts discuss the data. The FDA’s reasoning for authorizing each vaccine is available in the FDA Decision Memorandum.

Does the FDA monitor COVID-19 vaccine safety after authorization?

Yes. The FDA and the CDC have several systems in place to continually monitor COVID-19 vaccine safety. These systems, called “passive surveillance” and “active surveillance” systems, rapidly detect and investigate potential safety problems. Systems such as the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and CDC’s text-based v-safe system, which receive reports of adverse events following vaccination, are examples of passive surveillance systems. The FDA‘s BEST Initiative is an example of an active surveillance system, which can rapidly analyze information occurring in millions of individuals recorded in large data systems to investigate any safety signals that are identified by VAERS or v-safe.

Why are the FDA and CDC recommending a pause in the use of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine?

The FDA and CDC are reviewing data involving six cases reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) of a low level of platelets in the blood in combination with a rare and severe type of blood clot called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) in individuals who had received the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. One individual died. All cases occurred in females ranging in age from 18 through 48 years. In some of the reported cases of CVST, blood clots also involved large veins in the abdomen. Out of an abundance of caution, the FDA and CDC are recommending a pause in the use of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine while the FDA and CDC, including through its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices investigate these reports of serious adverse events. This is important, in part, to help ensure that health care providers are aware of the potential for these adverse events and can plan for proper recognition and management due to the unique treatment required for CVST with low levels of platelets. The safety monitoring program that is in place to monitor COVID-19 vaccines is working, as we were able to detect the reports of these very rare, serious adverse events early and take action to assess them. The FDA and CDC will continue to fully investigate all reports to determine if a causal relationship exists.

If I received the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine, am I at risk for these adverse events?

If you received the vaccine a month or more ago, the risk of these events appears to be extremely low. In all six cases, the symptoms occurred 6 to 13 days after vaccination. You should contact your health care provider immediately if you are experiencing any of the following symptoms:

These symptoms are distinct from the commonly reported side effects that people may experience in the first few days following vaccination, which can include headache, fatigue, muscle aches and nausea. Most of these side effects are mild to moderate in severity and last 1-2 days.

shortness of breath

chest pain

leg swelling

persistent abdominal pain

neurological symptoms (including severe or persistent headaches or blurred vision)

a diffuse rash on the skin consisting of pinpoint like spots (petechiae)

What should health care providers look for in evaluating Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine recipients for these rare events?

Healthcare providers should be alert to the signs and symptoms of thromboembolism and/or thrombocytopenia in individuals vaccinated with Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. In the management of cases of thromboembolism with thrombocytopenia following Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine, heparin and its derivatives should be avoided, and health care providers should consider consulting a hematologist.

The risks of severe illness

The known benefits of vaccination

The limited but growing evidence about the safety of vaccinations during pregnancy

Pregnant people are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19

Although the overall risk of severe illness is low, pregnant people are at an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 when compared with non-pregnant people. Severe illness includes illness that requires hospitalization, intensive care, or a ventilator or special equipment to breathe, or illness that results in death. Additionally, pregnant people with COVID-19 might be at increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth, compared with pregnant women without COVID-19.

Limited data are available about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines for people who are pregnant

Based on how these vaccines work in the body, experts believe they are unlikely to pose a risk for people who are pregnant. However, there are currently limited data on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnant people.

Clinical trials that study the safety of COVID-19 vaccines and how well they work in pregnant people are underway or planned. Vaccine manufacturers are also collecting and reviewing data from people in the completed clinical trials who received vaccine and became pregnant.

Studies in animals receiving a Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, or J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine before or during pregnancy found no safety concerns in pregnant animals or their babies.

CDC and the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) have safety monitoring systems in place to gather information about COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy and will closely monitor that information. Early dataexternal icon from these systems are preliminary, but reassuring. These data did not identify any safety concerns for pregnant people who were vaccinated or for their babies. Most of the pregnancies reported in these systems are ongoing, so more follow-up data are needed for people vaccinated just before or early in pregnancy. We will continue to follow people vaccinated during all trimesters of pregnancy to understand effects on pregnancy and babies.

The Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines are mRNA vaccines that do not contain the live virus that causes COVID-19 and therefore, cannot give someone COVID-19. Additionally, mRNA vaccines do not interact with a person’s DNA or cause genetic changes because the mRNA does not enter the nucleus of the cell, which is where our DNA is kept. Learn more about how COVID-19 mRNA vaccines work.

The J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine is a viral vector vaccine, meaning it uses a modified version of a different virus (the vector) to deliver important instructions to our cells. Vaccines that use the same viral vector have been given to pregnant people in all trimesters of pregnancy, including in a large-scale Ebola vaccination trial. No adverse pregnancy-related outcomes, including adverse outcomes that affected the infant, were associated with vaccination in these trials.

375,Study of Mosquito Protein Could Lead to Treatments Against Life Threatening Viruses,"Study of mosquito protein could lead to treatments against life-threatening viruses

NIAID

The mosquito protein AEG12 strongly inhibits the family of viruses that cause yellow fever, dengue, West Nile, and Zika and weakly inhibits coronaviruses, according to scientists at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and their collaborators. The researchers found that AEG12 works by destabilizing the viral envelope, breaking its protective covering. Although the protein does not affect viruses that do not have an envelope, such as those that cause pink eye and bladder infections, the findings could lead to therapeutics against viruses that affect millions of people around the world. The research was published online in PNAS.

Scientists at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), part of NIH, used X-ray crystallography to solve the structure of AEG12. Senior author Geoffrey Mueller, Ph.D., head of the NIEHS Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Group, said at the molecular level, AEG12 rips out the lipids, or the fat-like portions of the membrane that hold the virus together.

""It is as if AEG12 is hungry for the lipids that are in the virus membrane, so it gets rid of some of the lipids it has and exchanges them for the ones it really prefers,"" Mueller said. ""The protein has high affinity for viral lipids and steals them from the virus.""

As a result, Mueller says the AEG12 protein has great killing power over some viruses. While the researchers demonstrated that AEG12 was most effective against flaviviruses, the family of viruses to which Zika, West Nile, and others belong, it is possible AEG12 could be effective against SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. But, Mueller said it will take years of bioengineering to make AEG12 a viable therapy for COVID-19. Part of the problem is AEG12 also breaks opens red blood cells, so researchers will have to identify compounds that will make the protein target viruses only.

Alexander Foo, Ph.D., an NIEHS visiting fellow and lead author of the paper, explained that mosquitoes produce AEG12 when they take a blood meal or become infected with flaviviruses. Like humans, mosquitoes mount a vigorous immune response against these viruses, with AEG12 bursting their viral covering. But, at the beginning of the project, Foo and his colleagues knew little about the function of AEG12.

""The prospect of studying a new protein is exciting, yet daunting,"" Foo said. ""Thankfully, we had enough clues and access to a wide range of expertise at NIEHS to piece it together.""

Co-author and crystallography expert Lars Pedersen, Ph.D., is leader of the NIEHS Structure Function Group. He routinely uses information about a molecule’s physical makeup in his work and encourages more scientists to consider using this data in their studies.

How does hepatitis A spread?

Hepatitis A virus is found in the stool (poop) of a person who has the virus. It spreads when a person puts something in his or her mouth that has the hepatitis A virus on it. Even if the item looks clean, it can still have virus on it that can spread to others. The amount of stool can be so tiny that it cannot be seen with the naked eye. You can get it by touching objects such as doorknobs or diapers or eating food that has the virus on it.",www.cdc.gov
379,Vaccine Safety: MedlinePlus Health Topic,"Summary

What are vaccines?

Vaccines play an important role in keeping us healthy. They protect us from serious and sometimes deadly diseases. Vaccines are injections (shots), liquids, pills, or nasal sprays that you take to teach your body's immune system to recognize and defend against harmful germs. The germs could be viruses or bacteria.

Some types of vaccines contain germs that cause disease. But the germs have been killed or weakened enough that they won't make you sick. Some vaccines only contain a part of a germ. Other types of vaccines include instructions for your cells to make a protein of the germ.

These different vaccine types all spark an immune response, which helps your body fight off the germs. Your immune system will also remember the germ and attack it if that germ ever invades again. This protection against a certain disease is called immunity.

These diseases can be very serious. Because of this, getting immunity from a vaccine is safer than getting immunity by being sick with the disease. And for a few vaccines, getting vaccinated can actually give you a better immune response than getting the disease would.

Do vaccines cause side effects?

As with medicines, any vaccine can cause side effects. Most of the time the side effects are minor, such as a sore arm, fatigue, or mild fever. They usually go away within a few days. These common side effects are often a sign that your body is starting to build immunity against a disease.

Serious side effects from vaccines can happen, but they are very rare. These side effects could include a severe allergic reaction. Other possible side effects are different for each vaccine. Talk with your health care provider if you're concerned about your health after getting vaccinated.

Some people worry that childhood vaccines could cause autism spectrum disorder (ASD). But many scientific studies have looked at this and have found no link between vaccines and ASD.

How are vaccines tested for safety?

Every vaccine that is approved in the United States goes through extensive safety testing. It starts with testing and evaluation of the vaccine before it's approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This process can often take several years.

First, the vaccine is tested in labs. Based on those tests, the FDA decides whether to test the vaccine with people.

Testing with people is done through clinical trials. In these trials, the vaccines are tested on volunteers. Clinical trials usually start with 20 to 100 volunteers, but eventually include thousands of volunteers.

The clinical trials have three phases. The trials are looking for the answer to important questions such as Is the vaccine safe? What dose (amount) works best? How does the immune system react to it? How effective is it?

During the process, the FDA works closely with the company who makes the vaccine to evaluate the vaccine's safety and effectiveness. If the vaccine is found to be safe and effective, it will be approved and licensed by the FDA.

After a vaccine is licensed, experts may consider adding it to the recommended vaccine, or immunization, schedule. This schedule is from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It lists which vaccines are recommended for different groups of people. They list which age groups should get which vaccines, how many doses they need, and when they should get them.

Testing and monitoring continue after the vaccine is approved:

The company making the vaccines tests every batch of vaccines for quality and safety. The FDA reviews the results of these tests. It also inspects the factories where the vaccine is made. These checks help make sure the vaccines meet standards for quality and safety.

What is measles?

Measles is a serious respiratory disease (in the lungs and breathing tubes)

It causes a rash and fever.

It is very contagious.

In rare cases, it can be deadly.

What are the symptoms of measles?

Measles starts with a fever that can get very high. Some of the other symptoms that may occur are:

Cough, runny nose, and red eyes

Rash of tiny, red spots that start at the head and spread to the rest of the body

Diarrhea

Ear infection

Is measles serious?

Measles can be dangerous, especially for babies and young children.

For some children, measles can lead to:

Pneumonia (a serious lung infection)

Lifelong brain damage

Deafness

Death

How does measles spread?

Measles spreads when a person infected with the measles virus breathes, coughs, or sneezes.

It is very contagious.

You can catch measles just by being in a room where a person with measles has been, up to 2 hours after that person is gone.

And you can catch measles from an infected person even before they have a measles rash.

alert icon Almost everyone who has not had the MMR shot will get measles if they are exposed to the measles virus.

Is measles in the United States?

Every year, unvaccinated U.S. residents get measles while they are abroad and bring the disease into the United States and spread it to others.

Measles is common in other parts of the world, including countries in Europe, Asia, the Pacific Islands, and Africa. When people with measles travel into the United States, they can spread the disease to unvaccinated people including children too young to be vaccinated.

How many measles cases are there in the United States each year?

From year to year, measles cases can range from roughly less than 100 to a couple hundred.

However, in some years, there were more measles cases than usual. In 2019, 1282 people from 31 states were reported as having measles. These measles outbreaks are a key reminder of how quickly diseases can spread when children aren’t vaccinated. Most of these people got measles in the United States after being exposed to someone who got measles while in another country.",www.cdc.gov

A xylose test involves getting samples from both blood and urine. You will be tested before and after you drink a solution that contains 8 ounces of water that is mixed with a small amount of xylose.

For the blood tests:

A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial.

Next, you will drink the xylose solution.

You will be asked to rest quietly.

Your provider will give you another blood test two hours later. For children, it may be one hour later.

For the urine tests, you will need to collect all the urine you produce for five hours after you have taken the xylose solution. Your health care provider will give you instructions on how to collect your urine during the five-hour period.",medlineplus.gov

What is polio?

Polio, or poliomyelitis, is a disabling and life-threatening disease caused by the poliovirus. The virus can infect a person’s spinal cord, causing paralysis (can’t move parts of the body). Paralysis caused by poliovirus occurs when the virus replicates in and attacks the nervous system. The paralysis can be lifelong, and it can be deadly.

It most often sickens children younger than 5 years old.

What are the symptoms of polio infection?

Most people who get infected with poliovirus do not have any symptoms. Some people (25 people out of 100) will have flu-like symptoms. These symptoms usually last 2 to 5 days.

In rare cases, poliovirus infection can be very serious. About 1 out of 200 people will have weakness or paralysis in their arms, legs, or both. This paralysis or weakness can last a lifetime.

Is it serious?

The risk of lifelong paralysis is very serious. Even children who seem to fully recover can develop new muscle pain, weakness, or paralysis as adults, 15 to 40 years later.

About 2 to 10 children out of 100 who have paralysis from polio die because the virus affects the muscles that help them breathe.

How does polio spread?

Poliovirus is very contagious. It spreads through contact with:

the stool (poop) of an infected person.

droplets from a sneeze or cough of an infected person.

If you get stool or droplets from an infected person on your hands and you touch your mouth, you can get infected. Also, if your child puts objects, like toys, that have stool or droplets on them into their mouth, they can get infected.

An infected person may spread the virus to others immediately before and up to 2 weeks after symptoms appear.

The virus may live in an infected person’s stool for many weeks. He or she can contaminate food and water when they touch it with unwashed hands.

People who don’t have symptoms can still pass the virus to others and make them sick.

Do people still get polio in the United States?

No, thanks to a successful vaccination program, the United States has been polio-free for more than 30 years, but the disease still occurs in other parts of the world. It would only take one person with polio traveling from another country to bring polio back to the United States.",www.cdc.gov
384,Vaccine (Drops) for Rotavirus,"What are the side effects?

Side effects are rare, usually mild, and may include fussiness, diarrhea, and vomiting.

Some studies have shown a small rise in cases of intussusception within a week after the first or second dose of rotavirus vaccine. Intussusception is a type of bowel blockage that is treated in a hospital. Some babies might need surgery. Studies estimate a risk ranging from about 1 intussusception case in every 20,000 infants to 1 intussusception case in every 100,000 infants after vaccination.

What is rotavirus?

Rotavirus causes severe diarrhea and vomiting. It affects mostly babies and young children. Diarrhea and vomiting can lead to serious dehydration (loss of body fluid). If dehydration is not treated, it can be deadly.

What are the symptoms of rotavirus?

Rotavirus symptoms include:

Fever

Watery diarrhea

Vomiting

Stomach pain

Diarrhea and vomiting can last for three to eight days. Children may stop eating and drinking while they are sick.

Is rotavirus serious?

Rotavirus can be very harmful. Diarrhea, vomiting, and fever can cause a loss of body fluids. This leads to dehydration, which can be very dangerous, especially for babies and young children. Some children need an IV (needle in their vein) in the hospital to replace lost fluids.

How does rotavirus spread?

Rotavirus commonly spreads in families, hospitals, and childcare centers.

People who are infected with rotavirus shed the virus in their poop. If you get rotavirus particles in your mouth, you can get sick. This can happen if you

Touch contaminated objects or surfaces and then put your fingers in your mouth

Put your unwashed hands that are contaminated with poop into your mouth

Eat contaminated food

Rotavirus can survive on objects for several days. It is very difficult to stop its spread just by hand washing or disinfecting surfaces. The best way to protect young children from rotavirus is to get them vaccinated.",www.cdc.gov

386,Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR TB),"Fact Sheet

(PDFpdf icon – 37k)

Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR TB)

What is tuberculosis (TB)?

Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease caused by bacteria that are spread from person to person through the air. TB usually affects the lungs, but it can also affect other parts of the body, such as the brain, the kidneys, or the spine. In most cases, TB is treatable and curable; however, persons with TB can die if they do not get proper treatment.

What is multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB)?

Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR TB) is caused by an organism that is resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampin, the two most potent TB drugs. These drugs are used to treat all persons with TB disease.

What is extensively drug resistant tuberculosis (XDR TB)?

Extensively drug resistant TB (XDR TB) is a rare type of MDR TB that is resistant to isoniazid and rifampin, plus any fluoroquinolone and at least one of three injectable second-line drugs (i.e., amikacin, kanamycin, or capreomycin).

Because XDR TB is resistant to the most potent TB drugs, patients are left with treatment options that are much less effective.

XDR TB is of special concern for persons with HIV infection or other conditions that can weaken the immune system. These persons are more likely to develop TB disease once they are infected, and also have a higher risk of death once they develop TB.

How is TB spread?

Drug-susceptible TB and drug-resistant TB are spread the same way. TB bacteria are put into the air when a person with TB disease of the lungs or throat coughs, sneezes, speaks, or sings. These bacteria can float in the air for several hours, depending on the environment. Persons who breathe in the air containing these TB bacteria can become infected.

TB is not spread by

Shaking someone’s hand

Sharing food or drink

Touching bed linens or toilet seats

Sharing toothbrushes

Kissing

How does drug resistance happen?

Resistance to anti-TB drugs can occur when these drugs are misused or mismanaged. Examples include when patients do not complete their full course of treatment; when health-care providers prescribe the wrong treatment, the wrong dose, or length of time for taking the drugs; when the supply of drugs is not always available; or when the drugs are of poor quality.

Who is at risk for getting MDR TB?

Drug resistance is more common in people who:

Do not take their TB medicine regularly

Do not take all of their TB medicine as told by their doctor or nurse

Develop TB disease again, after having taken TB medicine in the past

Come from areas of the world where drug-resistant TB is common

Have spent time with someone known to have drug-resistant TB disease

How can MDR TB be prevented?

The most important thing a person can do to prevent the spread of MDR TB is to take all of their medications exactly as prescribed by their health care provider. No doses should be missed and treatment should not be stopped early. Patients should tell their health care provider if they are having trouble taking the medications. If patients plan to travel, they should talk to their health care providers and make sure they have enough medicine to last while away.

Health care providers can help prevent MDR TB by quickly diagnosing cases, following recommended treatment guidelines, monitoring patients’ response to treatment, and making sure therapy is completed.

Another way to prevent getting MDR TB is to avoid exposure to known MDR TB patients in closed or crowded places such as hospitals, prisons, or homeless shelters. If you work in hospitals or health-care settings where TB patients are likely to be seen, you should consult infection control or occupational health experts. Ask about administrative and environmental procedures for preventing exposure to TB. Once those procedures are implemented, additional measures could include using personal respiratory protective devices.

Is there a vaccine to prevent TB?

Yes, there is a vaccine for TB disease called Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG). It is used in some countries to prevent severe forms of TB in children. However, BCG is not generally recommended in the United States because it has limited effectiveness for preventing TB overall.

What should I do if I think I have been exposed to someone with TB disease?

If you think you have been exposed to someone with TB disease, you should contact your doctor or local health department about getting a TB skin test or TB blood test. And tell the doctor or nurse when you spent time with this person.

What are the symptoms of TB disease?

The general symptoms of TB disease include feelings of sickness or weakness, weight loss, fever, and night sweats. The symptoms of TB disease of the lungs may also include coughing, chest pain, and coughing up blood. Symptoms of TB disease in other parts of the body depend on the area affected. If you have these symptoms, you should contact your doctor or local health department.

389,Study of Mosquito Protein Could Lead to Treatments Against Life Threatening Viruses,"Study of mosquito protein could lead to treatments against life-threatening viruses

NIAID

The mosquito protein AEG12 strongly inhibits the family of viruses that cause yellow fever, dengue, West Nile, and Zika and weakly inhibits coronaviruses, according to scientists at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and their collaborators. The researchers found that AEG12 works by destabilizing the viral envelope, breaking its protective covering. Although the protein does not affect viruses that do not have an envelope, such as those that cause pink eye and bladder infections, the findings could lead to therapeutics against viruses that affect millions of people around the world. The research was published online in PNAS.

Scientists at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), part of NIH, used X-ray crystallography to solve the structure of AEG12. Senior author Geoffrey Mueller, Ph.D., head of the NIEHS Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Group, said at the molecular level, AEG12 rips out the lipids, or the fat-like portions of the membrane that hold the virus together.

""It is as if AEG12 is hungry for the lipids that are in the virus membrane, so it gets rid of some of the lipids it has and exchanges them for the ones it really prefers,"" Mueller said. ""The protein has high affinity for viral lipids and steals them from the virus.""

As a result, Mueller says the AEG12 protein has great killing power over some viruses. While the researchers demonstrated that AEG12 was most effective against flaviviruses, the family of viruses to which Zika, West Nile, and others belong, it is possible AEG12 could be effective against SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. But, Mueller said it will take years of bioengineering to make AEG12 a viable therapy for COVID-19. Part of the problem is AEG12 also breaks opens red blood cells, so researchers will have to identify compounds that will make the protein target viruses only.

Alexander Foo, Ph.D., an NIEHS visiting fellow and lead author of the paper, explained that mosquitoes produce AEG12 when they take a blood meal or become infected with flaviviruses. Like humans, mosquitoes mount a vigorous immune response against these viruses, with AEG12 bursting their viral covering. But, at the beginning of the project, Foo and his colleagues knew little about the function of AEG12.

""The prospect of studying a new protein is exciting, yet daunting,"" Foo said. ""Thankfully, we had enough clues and access to a wide range of expertise at NIEHS to piece it together.""

Co-author and crystallography expert Lars Pedersen, Ph.D., is leader of the NIEHS Structure Function Group. He routinely uses information about a molecule’s physical makeup in his work and encourages more scientists to consider using this data in their studies. He said, ""Our research shows that understanding the structure of a protein can be important in figuring out what it does and how it could help treat disease.""

What

A collaborative study conducted by scientists from the National Institutes of Health, Department of Defense (DOD), and multiple academic institutions has identified blood biomarkers that could help to predict which athletes need additional time to recover from a sports related concussion. This collaboration, known as the Concussion Assessment, Research, and Education (CARE) consortium, is supported, in part, by DOD and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).

In this study, conducted at several sites across the U.S., 127 male and female collegiate athletes who had sustained a sports-related concussion were tested at several time points: shortly after injury, when their symptoms resolved, and one week after returning to play. Each athlete had also undergone preseason, baseline testing.

Using an ultrasensitive assay that can detect minute amounts of protein, the researchers tested blood serum from these athletes and identified two blood proteins that were associated with the length of time needed by the athletes to return to play. Amounts of these two proteins, tau protein and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were found to be significantly different in athletes who needed less or more than 14 days to return. While further research is needed, the results of this study are an important step towards the development of a test that could help predict which athletes need more time to recover from a concussion and resume activity.

This study was published in JAMA Network Open.

395,"Blood-based Biomarker Can Detect, Predict Severity of Traumatic Brain Injury","Blood-based biomarker can detect, predict severity of traumatic brain injury

NIH Clinical Center

A study from the National Institutes of Health confirms that neurofilament light chain as a blood biomarker can detect brain injury and predict recovery in multiple groups, including professional hockey players with acute or chronic concussions and clinic-based patients with mild, moderate, or severe traumatic brain injury. The research was conducted by scientists at the NIH Clinical Center, Bethesda, Maryland, and published in the July 8, 2020, online issue of Neurology.

After a traumatic brain injury, neurofilament light chain breaks away from neurons in the brain and collects in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The scientists confirmed that neurofilament light chain also collects in the blood in levels that correlate closely with the levels in the CSF. They demonstrated that neurofilament light chain in the blood can detect brain injury and predict recovery across all stages of traumatic brain injury.

“Currently, there are no validated blood-based biomarkers to provide an objective diagnosis of mild traumatic brain injury or to predict recovery,” said Leighton Chan, M.D., M.P.H., chief of the Rehabilitation Medicine Department at the NIH Clinical Center. “Our study reinforces the need and a way forward for a non-invasive test of neurofilament light chain to aid in the diagnosis of patients and athletes whose brain injuries are often unrecognized, undiagnosed or underreported. “

The study examined multiple groups including professional hockey players in Sweden with sports-related concussions, hockey players without concussions, hockey players with persistent post-concussion symptoms, non-athlete controls, and clinic-based patients at the NIH Clinical Center who were healthy or with acute, subacute, and chronic mild traumatic brain injuries. The study showed that neurofilament light chain in the blood:

Correlated closely with CSF neurofilament light chain in hockey players with concussions and non-athlete healthy controls, suggesting that blood neurofilament light chain could be used instead of CSF neurofilament light chain.

Demonstrated strong diagnostic ability for sports-related concussions, where it could identify hockey players with concussions from hockey players without concussions and could identify clinic-based patients with mild, moderate, and severe traumatic brain injuries from each other and controls. This is significant as there is an unmet need for an easy and accessible blood biomarker to determine at the time of injury or in the chronic phase if a person has a concussion or signs of a traumatic brain injury.

Could distinguish with high accuracy hockey players who could return to play after 10 days from those who developed persistent post-concussion symptoms and eventually retired from the game. In the clinic-based cohort, patients with worse functional outcomes had higher blood neurofilament light chain levels. This is significant as there is an unmet need for a blood biomarker that can help clinicians to determine when athletes can safely return to play or when patients can return to work or resume daily activities.

In the clinic-based patients, the levels of blood neurofilament light chain at five years after a single mild, moderate, or severe traumatic brain injury were significantly increased compared to healthy controls. This suggests that even a single mild traumatic brain injury (without visible signs of structural damage on a standard clinical MRI) may cause long-term brain injury, and serum neurofilament light could be a sensitive biomarker to detect even that far out from initial injury.

“This study is the first to do a detailed assessment of serum neurofilament light chain and advanced brain imaging in multiple cohorts, brain injury severities, and time points after injury,” said the study’s lead author, Pashtun Shahim, M.D., Ph.D., NIH Clinical Center. “Our results suggest that serum neurofilament light chain may provide a valuable compliment to imaging by detecting underlying neuronal damage which may be responsible for the long-term symptoms experienced by a significant number of athletes with acute concussions, and patients with more severe brain injuries.”

The study was funded by the Intramural Research Program at NIH, the Department of Defense Center for Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine at the Uniformed Services University, and the Swedish Research Council.

Traumatic brain injury is a major leading cause of death and disability in the United States with more than 2.87 million emergency department visits, hospitalizations and deaths annually. While majority of all traumatic brain injuries are classified as mild (also known as a concussion), it remains difficult to diagnose this condition. There are a wide range of variable behavioral and observational tests to help determine a patient’s injuries but most of these tests rely on the patient to self-report signs and symptoms. Also, imaging has limitations with detecting micro-structural injuries in the brain.

""It is as if AEG12 is hungry for the lipids that are in the virus membrane, so it gets rid of some of the lipids it has and exchanges them for the ones it really prefers,"" Mueller said. ""The protein has high affinity for viral lipids and steals them from the virus.""

As a result, Mueller says the AEG12 protein has great killing power over some viruses. While the researchers demonstrated that AEG12 was most effective against flaviviruses, the family of viruses to which Zika, West Nile, and others belong, it is possible AEG12 could be effective against SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. But, Mueller said it will take years of bioengineering to make AEG12 a viable therapy for COVID-19. Part of the problem is AEG12 also breaks opens red blood cells, so researchers will have to identify compounds that will make the protein target viruses only.

Alexander Foo, Ph.D., an NIEHS visiting fellow and lead author of the paper, explained that mosquitoes produce AEG12 when they take a blood meal or become infected with flaviviruses. Like humans, mosquitoes mount a vigorous immune response against these viruses, with AEG12 bursting their viral covering. But, at the beginning of the project, Foo and his colleagues knew little about the function of AEG12.

""The prospect of studying a new protein is exciting, yet daunting,"" Foo said. ""Thankfully, we had enough clues and access to a wide range of expertise at NIEHS to piece it together.""

Co-author and crystallography expert Lars Pedersen, Ph.D., is leader of the NIEHS Structure Function Group. He routinely uses information about a molecule’s physical makeup in his work and encourages more scientists to consider using this data in their studies. He said, ""Our research shows that understanding the structure of a protein can be important in figuring out what it does and how it could help treat disease.""

397,Biomarkers Identified in Collegiate Athletes That Could Help Predict Time Needed to Recover From Concussion,"Biomarkers identified in collegiate athletes that could help predict time needed to recover from concussion

What

A collaborative study conducted by scientists from the National Institutes of Health, Department of Defense (DOD), and multiple academic institutions has identified blood biomarkers that could help to predict which athletes need additional time to recover from a sports related concussion. This collaboration, known as the Concussion Assessment, Research, and Education (CARE) consortium, is supported, in part, by DOD and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).

In this study, conducted at several sites across the U.S., 127 male and female collegiate athletes who had sustained a sports-related concussion were tested at several time points: shortly after injury, when their symptoms resolved, and one week after returning to play. Each athlete had also undergone preseason, baseline testing.

Using an ultrasensitive assay that can detect minute amounts of protein, the researchers tested blood serum from these athletes and identified two blood proteins that were associated with the length of time needed by the athletes to return to play. Amounts of these two proteins, tau protein and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were found to be significantly different in athletes who needed less or more than 14 days to return. While further research is needed, the results of this study are an important step towards the development of a test that could help predict which athletes need more time to recover from a concussion and resume activity.

This study was published in JAMA Network Open.

398,"Blood-based Biomarker Can Detect, Predict Severity of Traumatic Brain Injury","Blood-based biomarker can detect, predict severity of traumatic brain injury

NIH Clinical Center

A study from the National Institutes of Health confirms that neurofilament light chain as a blood biomarker can detect brain injury and predict recovery in multiple groups, including professional hockey players with acute or chronic concussions and clinic-based patients with mild, moderate, or severe traumatic brain injury. The research was conducted by scientists at the NIH Clinical Center, Bethesda, Maryland, and published in the July 8, 2020, online issue of Neurology.

After a traumatic brain injury, neurofilament light chain breaks away from neurons in the brain and collects in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The scientists confirmed that neurofilament light chain also collects in the blood in levels that correlate closely with the levels in the CSF. They demonstrated that neurofilament light chain in the blood can detect brain injury and predict recovery across all stages of traumatic brain injury.

“Currently, there are no validated blood-based biomarkers to provide an objective diagnosis of mild traumatic brain injury or to predict recovery,” said Leighton Chan, M.D., M.P.H., chief of the Rehabilitation Medicine Department at the NIH Clinical Center. “Our study reinforces the need and a way forward for a non-invasive test of neurofilament light chain to aid in the diagnosis of patients and athletes whose brain injuries are often unrecognized, undiagnosed or underreported. “

The study examined multiple groups including professional hockey players in Sweden with sports-related concussions, hockey players without concussions, hockey players with persistent post-concussion symptoms, non-athlete controls, and clinic-based patients at the NIH Clinical Center who were healthy or with acute, subacute, and chronic mild traumatic brain injuries. The study showed that neurofilament light chain in the blood:

Correlated closely with CSF neurofilament light chain in hockey players with concussions and non-athlete healthy controls, suggesting that blood neurofilament light chain could be used instead of CSF neurofilament light chain.

Demonstrated strong diagnostic ability for sports-related concussions, where it could identify hockey players with concussions from hockey players without concussions and could identify clinic-based patients with mild, moderate, and severe traumatic brain injuries from each other and controls. This is significant as there is an unmet need for an easy and accessible blood biomarker to determine at the time of injury or in the chronic phase if a person has a concussion or signs of a traumatic brain injury.

Could distinguish with high accuracy hockey players who could return to play after 10 days from those who developed persistent post-concussion symptoms and eventually retired from the game. In the clinic-based cohort, patients with worse functional outcomes had higher blood neurofilament light chain levels. This is significant as there is an unmet need for a blood biomarker that can help clinicians to determine when athletes can safely return to play or when patients can return to work or resume daily activities.

In the clinic-based patients, the levels of blood neurofilament light chain at five years after a single mild, moderate, or severe traumatic brain injury were significantly increased compared to healthy controls. This suggests that even a single mild traumatic brain injury (without visible signs of structural damage on a standard clinical MRI) may cause long-term brain injury, and serum neurofilament light could be a sensitive biomarker to detect even that far out from initial injury.

“This study is the first to do a detailed assessment of serum neurofilament light chain and advanced brain imaging in multiple cohorts, brain injury severities, and time points after injury,” said the study’s lead author, Pashtun Shahim, M.D., Ph.D., NIH Clinical Center. “Our results suggest that serum neurofilament light chain may provide a valuable compliment to imaging by detecting underlying neuronal damage which may be responsible for the long-term symptoms experienced by a significant number of athletes with acute concussions, and patients with more severe brain injuries.”

The study was funded by the Intramural Research Program at NIH, the Department of Defense Center for Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine at the Uniformed Services University, and the Swedish Research Council.

Traumatic brain injury is a major leading cause of death and disability in the United States with more than 2.87 million emergency department visits, hospitalizations and deaths annually. While majority of all traumatic brain injuries are classified as mild (also known as a concussion), it remains difficult to diagnose this condition. There are a wide range of variable behavioral and observational tests to help determine a patient’s injuries but most of these tests rely on the patient to self-report signs and symptoms. Also, imaging has limitations with detecting micro-structural injuries in the brain.

401,How to Cope with the Stress of Social Isolation,"Social isolation, or being physically separated from others, can lead to loneliness and increased stress, especially during a pandemic.

Loneliness has been associated with higher rates of depression, anxiety, and suicide. It can also weaken our immune systems, which helps protect us from getting sick. Luckily, understanding stress and loneliness and how to manage them can help.

How stress affects us

While some stress is normal, too much of it can interfere with daily activities, relationships, and work. Symptoms of stress and anxiety include:

Feeling irritable, restless, and on edge

Feeling overwhelmed and unmotivated

Muscle tension

Fatigue or tiredness

Difficulty concentrating

Combating stress

To combat stress, make sure to eat a diet full of heart-healthy fruits, vegetables, and grains. Get enough sleep (for adults, that is usually between 7 and 8 hours) and seek out physical activity.

Connecting with nature can lower levels of stress and reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression. A walk or bike ride may make you feel better and stay physically fit. Just 30 minutes of physical activity a day can make a big difference. Remember to wear a mask even when you are outside. Also, keep 6 feet of space between yourself and people who do not live in your home.

Combating loneliness

Avoiding in-person social gatherings will help keep you and others safe. But you can stay in touch with people in other ways:

Connect with loved ones through online games, video calls, or messaging apps.

Look online for virtual exercise classes, religious services, and cultural events.

Try at-home, guided yoga, mindfulness, or meditation through a mobile app.

Consider adopting a pet. Pets can provide comfort and lower blood pressure, according to the National Institute on Aging.

Reach out to a health care professional

Stress and social isolation can worsen existing mental illness. Consult your health care provider if your feelings are getting in the way of your daily life.

""For those with mental illnesses, be sure to continue your treatment regimens,"" says Joshua Gordon, M.D., Ph.D., director of the National Institute of Mental Health. ""Consider developing a plan for telehealth sessions with your provider if you (or your provider) are quarantined or must avoid exposures to the public for any reason.

403,Helping Your Child Heal after a Trauma,"

Larger text size Large text size Regular text size

Parents do everything they can to protect their children. But sadly, many kids have gone through trauma.

A trauma is any event that is deeply upsetting, scary, or harmful. Things like abuse, violence, accidents, or natural disasters can be traumas. Becoming homeless, losing a parent, or a serious illness can be traumas too.

Traumas are serious events that cause kids to fear for their life or safety.

After a trauma, the emotional effects can last a long time. It can be hard to move on. For some kids, trauma can lead to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

But kids can recover after trauma. There is therapy that can help. Kids also need extra support and comfort from parents.

How Does Trauma Affect Kids?

Trauma affects a child's sense of safety and trust. After a trauma, kids can still feel tense or scared. Some feel alone, sad, angry, or guilty. They may think they are to blame for what happened to them. For some kids, there's a loss of self-esteem or dignity. For some, there's deep grief.

Trauma also can affect a child's mood, behavior, or sleep. Some kids become depressed. They might act grumpy or seem sad. Some get in trouble more often or do worse in school. Some have new fears or trouble sleeping. Some have upsetting memories, called flashbacks. Often, kids avoid things that remind them of what they've been through.

After a trauma, some kids share how they feel. But other kids keep things to themselves. They may try to hide how they feel, or try to push it out of their minds. They may think others expect them to ""get over it."" Some just don't have words for their feelings. For any of these reasons, a parent might not know what their child is going through.

How Does Therapy Help Kids Heal After a Trauma?

Therapy gives kids a way to safely share their feelings, tell their story, and get support. In therapy, kids learn to talk about what they've been through. They learn coping and calming skills. They learn to adjust the way they think and feel about the trauma. Slowly, they learn to face things they used to avoid. Therapy helps kids find their own courage and gain confidence.

Child therapy for trauma is called trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (or TF-CBT). Therapy includes talk, play, and learning activities that heal trauma.

TF-CBT helps parents too. It's natural for parents to feel upset about what their child has been through. In therapy, parents get the support they need. They get advice on how to help their child at home.

In TF-CBT, parents can play a big role in their child's healing. They are coached to listen in ways that help their child open up, talk, and feel close. They help their child practice coping skills at home. They share in the good feelings as their child makes progress.

How Can I Find Therapy for My Child?

Talk to your child's doctor. Let them know what your child has been through. The doctor cares about your child's mental health too.

Ask the doctor to refer you to a trained child therapist who can help. You might need to take your child to therapy once a week for a few months. But you'll see progress along the way.

How Can I Give My Child the Extra Support They Need?

After a trauma, kids need your support and comfort more than ever. Be sure to:

Spend time with your child. Do things that are soothing, relaxing, or fun. Cook together, take a walk, play, read, make art, or sing. Try to do this every day, even if it's only for a few minutes.

Do things that are soothing, relaxing, or fun. Cook together, take a walk, play, read, make art, or sing. Try to do this every day, even if it's only for a few minutes.

Show them how to try again.

Use hugs, smiles, words, and caring actions to show your love. Use soothing words and offer comfort when your child is upset. Have soothing routines. Take a few minutes at bedtime (or any time) to read a story, snuggle together, or sing to your young child. For older kids, make it a routine to give a good night hug, along with a few minutes to talk, listen, or laugh together. Those extra few minutes with you can help your child feel calm, safe, and relaxed.

409,Pregnancy Check-Ups: Healthy Start for Mom and Baby,"Pregnancy Check-Ups

Healthy Start for Mom and Baby

Life is busy before a baby arrives. There are many things to do to prepare. One of the most important is to visit your health care provider regularly.

Check-ups before your baby is born are called prenatal visits. They help make sure you and your baby are healthy. Your health care provider will look for certain problems that can happen during pregnancy. Some issues are best treated early. Others can be prevented before they start.

“Prenatal care is fundamental for shaping the lives of women and their children,” says Dr. Monica Longo, an NIH expert on prenatal health. Longo cares for women with high-risk pregnancies. Such women have a higher chance of complications.

If you think you may be pregnant, schedule a visit with your provider. If you’re pregnant, you’ll need to start regular prenatal visits. Most women have check-ups about once a month in the beginning. Then, they go more often later in the pregnancy.

During a prenatal visit, your provider will ask about your health history. They will also perform a physical exam and weight check. They’ll let you know how much weight gain is healthy for your body and help track your progress.

You’ll also be asked to provide a urine sample. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common during pregnancy. UTIs and other infections increase the risk of having a preterm birth. This is when you give birth at 37 weeks or earlier.

“One of the primary purposes of prenatal care is actually prevention,” says Longo. “We screen women to find potential health problems before those issues can worsen.”

During certain stages of pregnancy, your provider will perform blood tests and imaging tests. These include ultrasound exams to look at the baby’s growth and development. Visits are also an opportunity to talk with your provider about how to give your baby a healthy start.

“During prenatal visits, we educ-ate and counsel moms about healthy habits, healthy food choices, and exercise,” Longo says. “We also address any concerns a new mom-to-be might have.”

Taking a prenatal vitamin is also key. Folic acid is included in most prenatal vitamins. It reduces the risk of severe birth defects that affect the developing brain and spine.

It’s important to stay away from things that could harm your baby. These include certain medications, smoking, and alcoholic drinks. Also, talk with your provider about any health conditions. Conditions like diabetes (a disease that causes high blood sugar) and high blood pressure need to be brought under control.

Some women choose to talk with their provider before becoming pregnant. This is called a preconception visit. It can help you plan for a safer pregnancy.

Early and regular care for you and your developing baby is important. Studies show that prenatal care reduces the risk of having a low-birth weight baby. Low birth weight can cause health problems. Even during the pandemic, it’s essential to keep up with regular prenatal care.

“Providers around the globe have adapted prenatal care to fit the current challenges,” says Longo. That means using telehealth for visits that don’t have to be done in person.

Health care providers are also seeing fewer patients and extending the time between them. This reduces possible exposure in waiting rooms.

“Providers are prepared for these difficult times,” says Longo. So it’s crucial that moms-to-be keep up with prenatal care.",newsinhealth.nih.gov

Now sure how to get started? These tips can help.

1. Talk with your doctor. Almost anyone, at any age, can exercise safely. If you're concerned about starting an exercise routine, talk with your doctor. Ask whether there are activities you should avoid and whether any health conditions you have might affect what exercises you can do safely.

2. Start gradually. Begin with low-intensity exercises like walking. Be sure to drink plenty of water before, during, and after your workout.

3. Develop a well-rounded routine. Include the four main types of exercise:

Endurance exercises increase your breathing and heart rate. Brisk walking is a good option.

Strength exercises, like lifting weights or using a resistance band, make your muscles stronger.

Balance exercises can help prevent falls. This includes standing on one foot.

Flexibility exercises, like yoga, stretch your muscles and help you stay limber and maintain mobility as you age.

Schedule a time for it. You are more likely to stick with an exercise routine if it is part of your day. Find a time that's most convenient for you, whether it's first thing in the morning or after work. If you don't have 30 full minutes to dedicate to exercise, try to be active a few times throughout the day.

Get active with friends. A workout buddy can help keep you accountable and make exercise more fun. During social distancing you can do this by working out with someone in your household or with a friend or family member digitally.

Measure your progress. Keep track of how far you walked, how much weight you lifted, or how far you stretched. Measuring your progress and noting improvements will help you stay motivated.

Try something new! Exercise shouldn't be boring. Trying a new exercise video or sport is one way to keep your exercise routine fresh.",magazine.medlineplus.gov
414,4 Physical Activity Tips for Older Adults,"Regular physical activity is great for your mental and physical health. It also helps you stay independent as you age.

Every day presents opportunities to move more.

The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommend that you aim to exercise at least 150 minutes every week at a moderate pace, or 75 at a more vigorous pace. The guidelines also recommend that older adults do muscle-strengthening activities at least 2 days a week.

Now sure how to get started? These tips can help.

1. Talk with your doctor. Almost anyone, at any age, can exercise safely. If you're concerned about starting an exercise routine, talk with your doctor. Ask whether there are activities you should avoid and whether any health conditions you have might affect what exercises you can do safely.

2. Start gradually. Begin with low-intensity exercises like walking. Be sure to drink plenty of water before, during, and after your workout.

3. Develop a well-rounded routine. Include the four main types of exercise:

Endurance exercises increase your breathing and heart rate. Brisk walking is a good option.

Strength exercises, like lifting weights or using a resistance band, make your muscles stronger.

Balance exercises can help prevent falls. This includes standing on one foot.

Flexibility exercises, like yoga, stretch your muscles and help you stay limber and maintain mobility as you age.

4. Move throughout the day. Every day presents opportunities to move more. For example, use the stairs instead of taking the elevator. Or park far away from the grocery store entrance instead of in the closest spot.",magazine.medlineplus.gov
415,Biomarkers Identified in Collegiate Athletes That Could Help Predict Time Needed to Recover From Concussion,"Biomarkers identified in collegiate athletes that could help predict time needed to recover from concussion

What

A collaborative study conducted by scientists from the National Institutes of Health, Department of Defense (DOD), and multiple academic institutions has identified blood biomarkers that could help to predict which athletes need additional time to recover from a sports related concussion. This collaboration, known as the Concussion Assessment, Research, and Education (CARE) consortium, is supported, in part, by DOD and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).

In this study, conducted at several sites across the U.S., 127 male and female collegiate athletes who had sustained a sports-related concussion were tested at several time points: shortly after injury, when their symptoms resolved, and one week after returning to play. Each athlete had also undergone preseason, baseline testing.

Using an ultrasensitive assay that can detect minute amounts of protein, the researchers tested blood serum from these athletes and identified two blood proteins that were associated with the length of time needed by the athletes to return to play. Amounts of these two proteins, tau protein and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were found to be significantly different in athletes who needed less or more than 14 days to return. While further research is needed, the results of this study are an important step towards the development of a test that could help predict which athletes need more time to recover from a concussion and resume activity.

This study was published in JAMA Network Open.

419,What Can Parents Do about Heavy Metals in Baby Food?,"

Larger text size Large text size Regular text size

I've heard about heavy metals in baby food. How can I keep my baby safe?

- Keeley

Heavy metals are found in soil, water, and the air we breathe. Plants take up these metals as they grow and can end up in the food we eat. Our bodies need some heavy metals (like iron and zinc) to work well, but other heavy metals (like arsenic and lead) are harmful. Some crops, like rice, absorb more of these harmful metals than others. Heavy metals can build up in the body over time and cause problems with learning, behavior, and attention.

When making baby food, companies add vitamins and minerals along with food additives that may contain heavy metals. Some baby foods have higher levels of heavy metals than others, including:

infant rice cereal

infant rice puff snacks

teething biscuits and rice rusks

fruit juice

carrots and sweet potatoes

Even organic baby food can have heavy metals in it.

The amount of heavy metals is low in baby foods, but you can take steps to lower it even more. Here are ways to do that:",kidshealth.org

A xylose test involves getting samples from both blood and urine. You will be tested before and after you drink a solution that contains 8 ounces of water that is mixed with a small amount of xylose.

For the blood tests:

A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial.

Next, you will drink the xylose solution.

You will be asked to rest quietly.

Your provider will give you another blood test two hours later. For children, it may be one hour later.

For the urine tests, you will need to collect all the urine you produce for five hours after you have taken the xylose solution. Your health care provider will give you instructions on how to collect your urine during the five-hour period.",medlineplus.gov
421,What is Malnutrition?,"Malnutrition is a common and detrimental condition that must be addressed quickly and comprehensively. Registered dietitian nutritionists are working hard to improve the speed and accuracy of malnutrition diagnosis and nutrition interventions in health care. Malnutrition is a physical state of unbalanced nutrition. It can mean undernutrition or overnutrition. When most people think of malnutrition, they usually picture undernutrition, which can be caused by a lack of calories, protein or other nutrients. This occurs frequently in areas of the world without adequate access to food and clean drinking water.

Overnutrition comes from eating too many calories. Someone can eat more calories than their body needs and be malnourished at the same time. They may not be eating enough nutritious foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, beans, low-fat dairy, nuts and seeds. This can result in vitamin, mineral or protein deficiencies. In the United States, this more commonly occurs in food insecure, impoverished areas.

Malnutrition in children, especially young children, can lead to stunted growth, developmental delays and more sickness due to poor immune function.

Clinical malnutrition is when a hospital patient becomes malnourished. There are many reasons why someone in the hospital may not be getting enough nutrition. For example, their body requires more nutrition than usual, or they are not able to absorb the nutrients they eat. Some hospital patients need to receive nutrition through a tube inserted into their stomach or even intravenous nutrition, where the digestive tract is bypassed altogether.

It is important that malnutrition is diagnosed in a timely manner. When a hospital patient becomes malnourished their medical treatment and recovery are affected. Research shows that malnutrition increases the risk of death, length of stay and health care costs. Hospitals are required to screen for malnutrition within 24 hours of patient admission.

Registered dietitian nutritionists make recommendations and work with the health care team to help patients receive the nutrition they need. RDNs assess malnutrition using weight history, dietary intake, lab values and a physical exam. A nutrition-focused physical exam involves checking for body fat and muscle loss, fluid accumulation and hand grip strength. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services requires long-term care facilities to employ registered dietitian nutritionists to manage the nutrition care of residents.

Malnutrition also can be the result of an eating disorder, organ failure or severe infection or physical trauma such as a head injury. Malnutrition frequently occurs in the older adult population, especially in those with dementia or Alzheimer’s disease. Tooth loss and other dental issues, loss of appetite and functional decline are contributing factors to malnutrition among older adults.",www.eatright.org
422,Healthy Food Choices for Your Family,"Page Content

​How can you ensure that your child is well nourished?

Here are some tips to keep in mind when planning and preparing meals for your family.

Variety

Your child should consume a variety of foods from the five major food groups. Each food group supplies important nutrients, including vitamins and minerals.



The five food groups and typical minimum servings:

Vegetables: 3-5 servings per day. A serving may consist of 1 cup of raw leafy vegetables, 3/4 cup of vegetable juice, or 1/2 cup of other vegetables, chopped raw or cooked.

Fruits: 2-4 servings per day. A serving may consist of 1/2 cup of sliced fruit, 3/4 cup of fruit juice, or a medium-size whole fruit, like an apple, banana, or pear.

Bread, cereal, or pasta: 6-11 servings per day. Each serving should equal 1 slice of bread, 1/2 cup of rice or pasta, or 1 ounce of cereal.

Protein foods: 2-3 servings of 2-3 ounces of cooked lean meat, poultry, or fish per day. A serving in this group may also consist of 1/2 cup of cooked dry beans, one egg, or 2 tablespoons of peanut butter for each ounce of lean meat.

Dairy products: 2-3 servings per day of 1 cup of low-fat milk or yogurt, or 1 1/2 ounces of natural cheese.

Fiber​

Fiber is a carbohydrate component of plant foods that is usually un-digestible. It is found in foods like fruits, vegetables, whole-grain breads, cereals, brown rice, beans, seeds, and nuts.

In adults: Increased fiber has been linked with a reduction of chronic gastrointestinal problems, including colon cancer, irritable bowel syndrome, and diverticulitis.

In children: Fiber's only proven benefit is its ability to ease constipation—providing bulk that can promote regular bowel movements, soften the stools, and decrease the time it takes food to travel through the intestines. But since food preferences and eating habits often get searly in life, and since high-fiber foods contain other nutrients, parents should include these foods in children's daily diets. See Kids Need Fiber: Here's Why and How.

Protein

Your child needs protein so their body can grow and function properly. This includes building new tissues and producing antibodies that help fight infections. Without essential amino acids (the building blocks of protein), children would be much more susceptible to serious diseases.

Protein-rich plants—such as dried beans and peas (legumes), grains, seeds, and nuts—can be used as valuable sources of protein. Other protein-rich foods include meat, fish, milk, yogurt, cheese, and eggs. These animal products contain high-quality protein and a full array of amino acids.

Keep in mind, however, that while red meat and shellfish are rich in protein and an important source of iron, they can also be high in fat and cholesterol as well. So, your child should consume them only in moderate amounts. Select lean cuts of meat and trim the fat before cooking. Likewise, remove skin from poultry before serving.

Fat

Humans cannot live without fats. They are a concentrated source of energy, providing essential fatty acids that are needed for a variety of bodily processes (metabolism, blood clotting, and vitamin absorption).

However, high fat intake—particularly a diet high in saturated fats—can cause problems. Saturated fats are usually solid at room temperatures and are found in fatty meats (such as beef, pork, ham, veal, and lamb) and many dairy products (whole milk, cheese, and ice cream). They can contribute to the buildup of plague in blood vessels and lead to heart disease later in life. A diet rich in saturated fats also can increase blood cholesterol, particularly in people who have inherited a tendency toward high cholesterol levels.

After age two: Children should be served foods that are lower in fat and saturated fats. Chances are that your child's favorite foods are higher in fat than is desirable. Healthy ating means relying more on low-fat, low-cholesterol foods like poultry, fish, and lean meat (broiled, baked, or roasted; not fried), soft margarine (instead of butter), low-fat dairy products, and low-saturated-fat oils from vegetables, while limiting egg consumption.

As a general guideline, fats should make up less than 30% of the calories in your child's diet. No more than about 1/3 or less of those fat calories should come from from saturated fat, with the rest coming from unsaturated (that is, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated) fats. These healthier fats are liquid at room temperature and include vegetable oils like corn, safflower, sunflower, soybean, and olive.

Some parents find the information about various types of fat confusing. In general, oils and fats that come from animals are saturated. The simplest place to start is just to reduce the amount of fatty foods of all types in your family's diet. See How to Reduce Fat and Cholesterol in Your Child's Diet.

Sugar

Limit the amount of sugar in your child's diet to to moderate levels. Sugar has plenty of calories, but dietitians often call them “empty calories"" because they have very little additional nutritional value. Even so, many children consume sugar in large amounts, usually at the expense of healthier foods. When children drink sodas, for example, they are usually leaving the milk in the refrigerator; when they eat a brownie, they may be overlooking the bowl of fruit, a good source of complex carbohydrates, on the kitchen table.

Salt

Table salt, or sodium chloride, may improve the taste of certain foods. However, researchers have found a relationship between salt in the diet and high blood pressure in some people.

High blood pres­sure afflicts about 25% of adult Americans ​​and contributes to heart attacks and strokes.

The habit of using extra salt is an learned one. So, as much as possible, serve your child foods low in salt. In the kitchen, minimize the amount of salt you add to food as you prepare it. Try using herbs, spices, or lemon juice instead. Take the salt shaker off the dinner table, or at least limit its use by your family.

Because salt acts a preservative, processed foods often contain large amounts of it. Salt-rich foods may include processed cheese, instant puddings, canned vegetables, canned soups, hot dogs, cottage cheese, salad dressings, pickles, and potato chips and other snacks.

423,Weaning Your Child,"

Larger text size Large text size Regular text size

What Is Weaning?

Weaning is when a baby moves from breast milk to other sources of nourishment. Weaning your baby is a process that takes patience and understanding from both you and your child.

When Is the Right Time to Wean?

When to wean is a personal decision. A mom might be influenced by a return to work, her health or the baby's, or simply a feeling that the time is right.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends feeding babies only breast milk for the first 6 months of life. After that, the AAP recommends a combination of solid foods and breast milk until a baby is at least 1 year old. Then, babies may begin drinking whole cow's milk.

Most experts agree that breastfeeding should continue for as long as it suits mother and baby. Many women choose to wean after their baby's first birthday. At this age, babies are starting to walk, talk, and eat more solid foods. So they may naturally lose interest in nursing.

Other moms breastfeed longer than a year (this is called extended breastfeeding). Extended breastfeeding is a healthy and reasonable option for mothers and children who aren't ready to wean. In fact, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that moms breastfeed for the first 2 years of a child's life.

Weaning does not have to be all-or-nothing. Some women choose to wean during the day and breastfeed at night, depending on their work situation and their schedules.

Whenever you decide to wean, your child may have another time in mind. Some children wean themselves earlier than the mother intended and others resist weaning when the mother is ready. Those wean later in life tend to be more resistant. For example, a 2-year-old toddler may be more attached and less flexible about giving up breastfeeding than a 12-month-old baby. At times like these, it's important to take it slow and be sensitive to each other's needs.

Signs Your Baby May Be Weaning

Some kids are content to nurse indefinitely. But others will give moms clues that they're ready to begin the process of weaning, such as:

seeming disinterested or fussy when nursing

nursing in shorter sessions than before

being easily distracted while nursing

""playing"" at the breast, like constantly pulling on and off or biting. Babies who bite during nursing should immediately be taken off the breast and told, calmly but firmly, ""No biting. Biting hurts.""

nursing for comfort (sucking at the breast but not drawing out the milk)

Approaches to Weaning

To let both mom and baby adjust physically and emotionally to the change, weaning should be done over time.

One approach is to drop one feeding session a week until your child takes all the feeds from a bottle or cup. If you want to give your child pumped breast milk, you'll need to pump to keep up your milk supply. If you are weaning your child off breast milk, slowly dropping feeds can help avoid engorgement.

You might begin by stopping the midday feeding because it's usually the smallest and most inconvenient — especially for working moms. Many mothers let go of the bedtime feeding last because it's still a special part of bonding.

Some moms leave the decision of when to wean up to their child. Children who are eating three meals of solid food a day (plus snacks) often breastfeed less and less. In that case, a mom's milk will dry up from lack of demand and she'll need to pump to keep the milk flowing. If your child is breastfeeding less, make sure he or she is getting enough iron-fortified formula or milk. Check with the doctor about how much your child should get.

If your baby weans before 1 year of age, or you find that you're not making enough milk, you will need to give your baby formula. Check with the doctor to see what formula is right for your little one.

Making the Change Easier

Weaning is easier if a child has also taken milk from another source. So try giving an occasional bottle of breast milk to your little one after breastfeeding is well-established. Even if you continue breastfeeding, this can ease weaning later. It also lets other family members feed the baby and makes it possible to leave your child with a caregiver.

Remember that infants over 6 months should have solid foods as well as breast milk. After 1 year, breast milk alone does not provide all the nutrients a growing child needs. So solid foods must become a regular part of the diet.

As you start to wean, remember that your child needs time to adjust to drinking from cups. Be patient as your little one begins exploring the world of food.

Here are some more ways to make this change easier:

Engage your child in a fun play activity or an outing during times when you would usually nurse.

Avoid sitting in your usual nursing spots or wearing your usual nursing clothes.

Delay weaning if your child is trying to adapt to some other change. Trying to wean when your little one is just beginning childcare or during teething might not be a good idea.

If your baby is younger than 1 year, try to introduce a bottle or cup when you would typically be nursing. For an older child, try a healthy snack, offering a cup, or maybe a cuddle.

Try changing your daily routine so that you're otherwise engaged during breastfeeding times.

Enlist your partner's help to provide a distraction at a typical nursing time.

If your child picks up a comforting habit (such as thumbsucking) or becomes attached to a security blanket, don't discourage it. Your child might be trying to adjust to the emotional changes of weaning.

How You Might Feel

Many moms make the decision to wean with mixed emotions. Weaning brings more freedom and flexibility, and the proud realization that a child is reaching a milestone. But nursing is an intimate activity that fosters a strong bond between mother and child — and some women find it hard to let that go.

So expect a wide range of emotions, and understand that your child may have them too. Also remember that there will be countless other ways to nurture your child in the days ahead.",kidshealth.org
424,Comfort Care for Kids and Their Families: A Mother's Story,"When Jake Swoyer was born in 1995, he seemed like any other healthy baby boy. His family—parents, John and Barbara Swoyer, and big brother Ryan, then 3— were thrilled.

But when Jake, who is from Sudbury, Massachusetts, was 7 months old, he had his first seizure. After that, ""he got very sick, very quickly,"" his mother says. His seizures came frequently and could last up to an hour. ""We had 23 ambulance rides in that first year.""

""I had no idea what palliative care really was or what it could do for us."" – Barbara Swoyer

Despite a lot of testing, doctors were unable to determine a cause for his seizures until Jake was nearly 10 years old, when a test revealed he had a genetic mutation associated with Dravet syndrome. Dravet syndrome is a lifelong, rare form of epilepsy that begins in the first year of life and typically doesn't respond to medication. Jake was also later diagnosed with mitochondrial dysfunction, adding to the severity and complexity of his disease.

Since he was diagnosed, Jake has suffered a long, slow, steady decline in his health, his mother says. Palliative care has made all the difference in how the family has coped with Jake's devastating condition and in helping Jake enjoy a good quality of life. He received pediatric palliative care support and services until he turned 21.

Finding palliative care

""When Jake was first diagnosed, our physician suggested enrolling him in palliative care. Like many families, my first thought was, 'Oh no, he thinks my son is dying.' I had no idea what palliative care really was or what it could do for us,"" Barbara recalls.

She finally took his suggestion after about a year. As Barbara worked with several different providers, ""a light bulb finally went off. I realized what palliative care was supposed to be,"" she says. ""Along with providing clinical and emotional support, the palliative team introduced comfort care measures. Jake was able to receive pet therapy for enjoyment, massage therapy for relaxation, and music therapy for active engagement and socialization. Each of these therapies brought joy and positive change into his daily life.""

Palliative care services also included a medical team to help with medical support and crisis management, Barbara says. ""They could come to the house, diagnose a problem, and prescribe and provide treatment. We didn't have to go to the hospital for every problem."" Having home-based medical support allowed the family to treat problems in their own home, which became especially important as Jake got older.

Embracing a difficult but important path

A chaplain and a social worker paid regular visits to the Swoyer home.

""In 25 years of caring for a child with limited life expectancy, these were two of the more meaningful and pivotal people I had the opportunity to work with,"" Barbara says. They were open to and encouraged philosophical discussion about Jake's eventual end of life.

""They helped us consider and define our goals of care,"" Barbara says. ""From these conversations, we felt at peace with past decisions and better equipped to make future decisions on Jake's behalf. It was a relief to have these discussions in periods of calm, rather than in moments of crisis.""

Barbara is a founding member of the Parent Advisory Board for Courageous Parents Network, a nonprofit organization that helps families and providers caring for children with serious illness. Her wish is for families to understand that palliative care is about helping a child live well in the face of life-threatening disease.

""It's about bringing happiness and comfort to a child, while also supporting the entire family unit, no matter where they are on their journey with serious illness,"" she says.

425,New Research on Palliative Care and COVID-19,"Jean Kutner, M.D., a professor of medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, is a well-known expert in palliative and hospice care. She is also a top researcher in the field. She says palliative care ""focuses on the whole person, addressing their spiritual, psychological, and medical needs along the whole course of their journey with a serious illness.""

This year, the COVID-19 pandemic has spotlighted the need for doctors and nurses trained in palliative care. Hospitals are treating thousands of seriously ill patients. Many of them may end up on life support with their families unable to be with them.

Dr. Kutner discussed how palliative care teams are helping patients and families during this time.

Doctors and nurses trained in palliative care have been in high demand during the pandemic. Has the crisis shown people how this kind of care can help patients and their families?

Yes, absolutely. At hospitals across the country, there has been increased demand for palliative care teams. They help overwhelmed families, patients, and hospital staff cope with this very serious illness. It has been especially hard for patients and families who have to be separated because the virus is so contagious. A palliative care team can support families that have to make difficult decisions. The pandemic has also shown the importance of having conversations about the goals of care—such as, do you want to be on a ventilator?—and documenting someone who can make medical decisions for a patient who is seriously ill or dying. This is also known as a health care proxy.

""A palliative care team can support families that have to make difficult decisions."" – Jean Kutner, M.D.

Much of the early research on the benefits of palliative care involved cancer patients. How is the scope of palliative care expanding?

It's true that palliative care had its roots in helping people with cancer. In the last five-plus years, there has been more work with people who have Parkinson's, ALS, heart failure, lung diseases like COPD, advanced kidney disease, and dementia. These groups have different needs than cancer patients. There's also been exciting research supporting children and adolescents with progressive, life-limiting illness.

Can you tell us about the NIH-funded research you are involved in?

I am the lead researcher in a large national project funded by the National Institute of Nursing Research on providing training for other palliative care researchers. I'm also doing research on training palliative care providers to help families with the most difficult conversations regarding a family member's health.

Until recently, people may not have heard of palliative care or confused it with hospice care. Is that changing?

When I gave talks to public groups about palliative care 10 years ago, I often would get blank stares. But that is changing. More people have heard of it. There is also a growing number of patient and provider groups who are huge advocates of it. I especially see that among our nursing and medical school students, even clinical psychology students. When I do interviews for residency programs in internal medicine, the students ask about rotations in palliative care. They feel it's important. This generation of trainees is truly going to change this field.",magazine.medlineplus.gov

Community Supports for Rural Aging in Place and Independent Living

Older adults (those aged 65 and older) and people with disabilities have unique healthcare needs and often face challenges to meeting these needs. In addition, accessible housing, transportation, employment, educational programs, and specialized healthcare may be limited in many parts of rural America. Community organizations, healthcare facilities, local governments, and other rural entities can help older adults and people with disabilities by collaborating and creatively using limited resources to provide needed services.

This guide includes information about home-based services and community supports available to support aging in place and independent living and discusses challenges for people receiving services and those providing them. For information related to services for veterans with service-related injuries, see Rural Veterans and Access to Healthcare.

Frequently Asked Questions

What types of services and supports can help rural residents to age in place and live independently, and who delivers these services?

Older individuals and people with disabilities may experience physical limitations and need to rely on others for help with activities of daily living. This can be particularly challenging in rural areas. Home and Community-Based Alternatives to Nursing Home Care notes that a wide range of services can help individuals live independently. Types of services that can support aging in place and independent living include, but are not limited to:

Family caregivers, community business and nonprofit organizations, paid home care workers, senior centers, tribal organizations, and volunteers can all provide help to people in rural communities. However, home health services, which are specifically medical in nature, must be provided by skilled medical professionals.

The National Academy for State Health Policy's 2019 Toolkit: State Strategies to Support Older Adults Aging in Place in Rural Areas describes a variety of state initiatives designed to help older rural adults remain in their communities. SASH® (Support and Services at Home) utilizes affordable housing communities throughout Vermont to provide care and services to older adults and individuals with disabilities and promote independent living. The ARcare Aging Well Outreach Network, run by the ARcare Federally Qualified Health Center, provides services including falls prevention assessments, transportation to appointments, medication management, and senior-specific exercise opportunities for Cross County, Arkansas residents over 50 years of age.

For additional examples of home-based services and community supports in rural communities, see the RHIhub's Rural Aging in Place and Access to Care for Rural People with Disabilities Toolkits.

What other services and supports might people with disabilities need in order to live successfully in a rural community?

People with disabilities may use some of the same services and supports as older adults to be able to live independently in rural areas. However, rural residents with disabilities may also benefit from other services and supports. For example, they may experience pain and other secondary conditions that may make it difficult to hold a job. As a result, people with disabilities may need specialized training or rehabilitation services or other assistance to overcome barriers to employment or pursue self-employment. Farm Assessment and Rehabilitation Methods (FARM) Program is one example of a program designed to help disabled farmers continue or resume farming or find an alternative agricultural occupation.

People with disabilities may also need assistance connecting with community services and supports as they transition from a facility back into the community or as they transition into adulthood. Centers for Independent Living (CILs) provide individuals with disabilities with services to help them live independently, including referrals, independent living skills training, and peer counseling. CILs can also offer additional services, including job search support, assistive technology information, and housing option counseling.

People with disabilities and functional limitations also require additional supports in emergency situations. Individuals who are hard of hearing may not hear sirens or other audible alerts, while those with vision impairments may not see flashing lights or other signals. In an emergency, people who use assistive technologies or durable medical equipment may need access to back-up sources of power. Additionally, people with functional disabilities may need accessible transportation options or shelters if evacuation is necessary. For information on preparing and responding to emergencies in rural communities, see RHIhub's Rural Emergency Preparedness and Response topic guide.

Why is it important for people living in rural areas to have access to home-based services and community supports?

Older adults and people with disabilities living in rural areas, like their urban counterparts, typically prefer to live in their own homes, rather than in assisted living facilities or nursing homes. While they may be able to thrive in the community, older adults and individuals with disabilities may also need some assistance in carrying out key everyday activities such as bathing or cooking. Similarly, Differences in Social Isolation and Its Relationship to Health by Rurality highlights that while older adults in rural areas report larger social networks than their urban counterparts, they experience increased risks of social isolation and loneliness. Social isolation among older adults has been linked to poor health outcomes and increased healthcare spending. As a result, rural areas may need to provide additional services and supports to keep older adults and people with disabilities included and active in community life. Older adults and people with disabilities may also face additional challenges in rural areas related to:

Transportation to medical appointments, grocery shopping, and other essential and leisure activities

Housing quality and affordability, including how to pay for needed repairs, modifications, and assistive technologies that would allow them to continue to live safely in the home

Availability of home-based services and community supports in their communities that will allow them to live independently at home.

Paid caregiver workforce shortages.

Support for informal caregivers to prevent feelings of isolation and burnout.

Meeting the Social Needs of Older Adults in Rural Areas demonstrates how home-based services and community supports can foster social connections as well as connect residents with needs and services that promote health and wellness.

What are livable communities, and how do they facilitate aging in place and independent living in rural communities?

Livable communities meet the full range of needs of all its residents. Partners for Livable Communities defines livability as “the sum of the factors that add up to a community's quality of life—including the built and natural environments, economic prosperity, social stability and equity, educational opportunity, and cultural, entertainment and recreation possibilities.” AARP also notes that a livable community will “enhance personal independence; allow residents to remain in their homes and communities; and foster residents' engagement in the community's civic, economic, and social life.” As a result, the exact characteristics of livability will be unique to each community.

The terms “aging in place” and “independent living” describe different aspects of livable communities. People who want to age in place are those who want to remain in a place of their choice, typically one in which they have invested time and money, where they have an informal support network and which holds fond memories for them. There are typically fewer housing options available in rural communities, making it difficult to downsize or find accessible housing. Also, home repairs or modifications may be necessary for an individual to remain in their community. Similarly, nutrition services may be necessary for adults who cannot safely cook for themselves. For more information on aging in place in rural communities, see the RHIhub's Rural Aging in Place Toolkit.

The term independent living can simply refer to an arrangement in which people with disabilities live in a community rather than in an institutional setting. Interpreted more broadly, it is a philosophy which promotes the idea that people with disabilities have the same civil rights as people without disabilities, and should make their own decisions about how they will live, work, and participate in society in the least restrictive environment. This approach focuses on ensuring that communities meet the needs of all people who live there.

Universal design principles should be considered when designing rural infrastructure. Universal design goes beyond meeting accessibility standards and seeks to address usability concerns for people of all ages and abilities throughout the entire design of a building or community. Curb cuts are one example of universal design. Originally designed to improve access for individuals with mobility and visual impairments, curb cuts also assist cyclists, families with strollers, and travelers with luggage, among many others.

By embracing the concepts of aging in place, independent living, and universal design, communities can help individuals remain and thrive in their homes or community setting of their choice, no matter their age or ability. For information on evidence-based and promising models and resources to support organizations and communities in creating rural livable communities, see the RHIhub's Rural Aging in Place and Access to Care for Rural People with Disabilities Toolkits.

What resources are available to find services for older adults and individuals with disabilities who wish to remain in their homes?

The National Institute on Aging's webpage Aging in Place: Growing Old at Home offers suggestions for planning ahead to stay at home, lists the kinds of supports that may be needed, and offers contact information for various agencies and programs that can provide help and guidance. It notes that resources can include:

Friends, family, and neighbors

Community businesses and nonprofit organizations

Geriatric care managers

Senior centers

Area Agencies on Aging

Tribal organizations

Federal, state, and local government resources

The World Health Organization defines age-friendly environments as ones that:

“foster health and well-being and the participation of people as they age. They are accessible, equitable, inclusive, safe and secure, and supportive. They promote health and prevent or delay the onset of disease and functional decline. They provide people-centered services and support to enable recovery or to compensate for the loss of function so that people can continue to do the things that are important to them.”

Centers for Independent Living are community-based, consumer-controlled nonprofit organizations funded by the Administration for Community Living (ACL) to provide individuals with disabilities a range of services to promote independent living. While CILs can offer more services, they are required to provide information and referral services, independent living skills training, peer counseling, and services that facilitate transition from nursing homes and other institutions to the community. ACL maintains a state-by-state list of Centers for Independent Living.

The Grantmakers in Aging publication Guiding Principles for the Sustainability of Age-Friendly Community Efforts notes that “Champions for age-friendly communities can be found in neighborhoods, elected offices, non-profit organizations, universities, and businesses.” Churches and local nonprofit organizations may be helpful in providing services or referrals. Age-Friendly and Dementia-Friendly Winnemucca and Humboldt County describes how the rural community of Winnemucca, Nevada, worked to create an age-friendly and dementia-friendly community that expanded to Humboldt County.

The National PACE (Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly) Association supports and promotes programs that provide comprehensive medical care and community-based services to help older people live as independently as possible for as long as possible. RHIhub's Rural Services Integration Toolkit highlights the work of Senior CommUnity Care (Delta and Montrose Counties, Colorado), an example of a rural PACE program. For a list of currently operating PACE centers, search Find a PACE Program in Your Neighborhood.

The Eldercare Locator, 1.800.677.1116, provides access to state and local Area Agencies on Aging, as well as community-based organizations and services addressing a range of concerns, including housing, transportation, elder abuse prevention, and more. Churches and civic groups may also be able to make referrals to local sources for services.

What are the workforce and training challenges related to providing home-based services and community supports?

State Solutions to the Home Care Workforce Crisis in Rural America notes that many workers providing home-based services in rural areas work only part-time, earning less on average than workers in urban areas. According to the report Preventing Caregiver Turnover, low wages are a major factor in the high turnover rate among home care workers. This results in a heavier workload for employees who do remain, and creates losses in productivity, morale problems, and a lack of care management. In addition, National Survey of Area Agencies on Aging 2020 Report: Meeting the Needs of Today's Older Adults reports that workforce challenges have resulted in 62% of AAAs delaying the start of services for individuals, 59% increasing the size of staff caseloads, and 49% starting or extending waitlists for services.

As more medical care for people with multiple chronic conditions takes place in the home, the care provided in the home becomes more complex and requires additional skills. As described in the Government Accountability Office report Medicaid Home- and Community-Based Services: Selected States' Program Structures and Challenges Providing Services, recipients of home- and community-based services may have complex medical and behavioral needs and may display aggressive behaviors. In response, some organizations may offer specialized behavioral health training to help workers deal with these situations appropriately.

What does a lack of home-based services and community supports in a community mean for older adults, people with disabilities, and their families?

Caregiving in the U.S. 2020, a report from AARP and the National Alliance for Caregiving, offers a national profile of unpaid family caregivers for rural adults. Notably, family caregivers of older adults living in rural areas often do not live in a rural area themselves and continue to work while serving as a primary caregiver. The report also highlights that caregivers are likely to find it difficult to find available, affordable services in rural communities.

The report Transportation, Distance, and Health Care Utilization for Older Adults in Rural and Small Urban Areas notes that people who do not have access to reliable transportation are more likely to delay getting needed healthcare or forego it entirely. This can result in a need for emergency care or a hospitalization that could otherwise have been avoided. For more information on the consequences of a lack of transportation for rural residents who have disabilities or are older, see the RHIhub Transportation to Support Rural Healthcare topic guide.

Rural people who are unable to find necessary supports in their community may have little choice but to relocate to a nursing home. According to the policy brief Are Rural Older Adults Benefiting from Increased State Spending on Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services?, rural Medicaid beneficiaries were more likely to use skilled nursing facilities than urban Medicaid beneficiaries. Similarly, Rural Long-Term Services and Supports: A Primer describes how rural residential care facilities, such as assisted living facilities, serve populations with more diverse needs than facilities in urban areas. This may reflect that there are few long-term care options in rural areas, in addition to the possible lack of other support services in the community.

How can home-based services and community supports help informal caregivers?

The August 2019 publication Supportive Services and Caregiving for Rural Adults: Policy Brief and Recommendations to the Secretary from the National Advisory Committee on Rural Health and Human Services (NACRHHS) notes that nearly 44 million family and friends serve as informal, unpaid caregivers to older adults and individuals with disabilities each year. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one in four rural adults provide care or assistance to a friend or family member with a health concern or disability. Over half of these caregivers provide care for over two years, and 30% spend at least 20 hours per week providing care. As a result, informal caregivers can incur psychological, physical, and financial stress when caring for another individual.

Home-based services and community supports can benefit friend and family caregivers as well as patients. For example, reliable, accessible transportation services can allow caregivers to maintain regular work hours with the peace of mind that their loved ones can visit grocery stores, attend community centers, or travel to medical appointments. The Missouri Rural Health Association's HealthTran program coordinates non-emergency medical transportation for individuals who need routine and preventative medical care. Similarly, adult day centers provide supervised care to dependent adults, relieving caregivers from attending to their family members continuously throughout the day.

The policy brief Perspectives on Rural Caregiving Challenges and Interventions examines strategies for supporting informal caregivers. Key informants noted that increased financial support, development of a national strategy, and expanded access to resources would all be beneficial for informal caregivers. On a local level, the following strategies are helpful:

Increase awareness of caregivers' needs through workplace programs and churches

Provide infrastructure to enable rural families to more easily access technology services

Offer training to caregivers, so that they will feel more prepared and confident in their ability to help loved ones

Improve Medicaid services

Expand family leave policies and economic incentives for caregivers

Offer screening for caregiver depression and isolation

The 2019 Milbank Memorial Fund report In Support of Family Caregivers: A Snapshot of Five States notes that as demographics change and the country has a larger percentage of older Americans, there will be a need for public policies to support family and unpaid caregivers. For example, the Maine housing administration provides up to $3,800 in tax credits for home modifications for older adults, and Minnesota used grant funding from its Live Well at Home program to partner with Chicago REST (Respite Education Support Tools) to increase the availability of respite care for caregivers.

Resources for Caregiving in Rural Communities gives descriptions and contact information for several national and state-level programs that provide services.

For more information on the challenges and opportunities informal caregivers experience in adopting technology to aid their caregiving efforts, read the Rural Monitor article Informal Caregiving and Technology in Rural America.

What is the Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services Waiver Program?

In the past, long-term support services funded by Medicaid have typically been delivered in nursing facilities or other institutions. However, Medicaid's home and community-based services waivers (HCBS or 1915(c) Waivers) allow states to develop programs to meet needs of Medicaid beneficiaries who want to remain in their own homes or communities. States can apply for multiple waivers to tailor programs and services to specific groups identified by age or diagnosis. Waiver programs must:

Show that the services provided under the waiver will not cost more than the same services provided in an institution.

Ensure that people's health and welfare will be protected

Establish standards for providers to meet the needs of the participants

Develop and follow a plan of care that is individualized and person-centered

Key State Policy Choices About Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services highlights the variation in how these services are provided at the state level. However, Are Rural Older Adults Benefiting from Increased State Spending on Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services?, a 2016 report from the Maine Rural Health Research Center, examines how urban and rural older adults utilize these services differently.

For more information, see Medicaid's Home & Community-Based Services 1915(c).

What other funding opportunities are available for rural home-based services and community supports?

Local agencies such as Area Agencies on Aging, Aging and Disability Resource Centers, Centers for Independent Living and nonprofit or faith-based organizations are often the best funding sources for rural home-based services. For a list of grant programs and organizations that have funded activities to support aging in place and independent living, see the Funding & Opportunities section of this topic guide.

What are some food and nutrition programs for seniors in rural communities who spend most of their time at home?

The Administration for Community Living's Administration on Aging administers the Nutrition Services Program, which provides grants to states to promote nutrition services programs for older adults. These include:

Home-delivered meals

Meals served in group settings, such as community centers

Nutrition screening

Assessment

Education

Counseling

The programs are intended to reach people age 60 and above who have the greatest social and economic needs. Section 339 of the Older Americans Act of 1965 provides nutrition services programs the ability to also serve spouses of any age, people who provide volunteer services during meal hours, and people with disabilities. Priority is given to the following groups:

Low-income adults

Members of minority groups

Seniors in rural areas

Seniors who have limited proficiency in English

Seniors at risk for needing institutional care

According to the Administration on Community Living (ACL), “home-delivered meals are often the first in-home service that an older adult receives, and the program is a primary access point for other home and community-based services.” A 2015 research brief, Older Americans Benefit from Older Americans Act Nutrition Programs, highlights the connection between the health and ability of recipients of these services to remain at home.

Meals on Wheels America has more than two million staff members and volunteers who deliver meals to frail, homebound, or isolated seniors. The organization notes on its website that it serves “virtually every community in America,” and provides funding, leadership, education, research, and advocacy support.

Some rural communities have food pantries, which may provide food and other basic products. The Rural Monitor article Food Pantries Serving More and More of the Rural Poor gives examples of rural food pantry programs which are funded by federal programs, state governments, foundations, businesses, religious organizations, and individuals.

For more information about nutrition programs for rural seniors, see RHIhub's Rural Hunger and Access to Healthy Food topic guide.

Where can I find information on community-based transportation services?

People in rural areas often have difficulty finding adequate transportation. Those with medical needs requiring specialized care available only in larger communities may find it particularly challenging to access affordable, long-distance transportation to these locations.

The National Aging and Disability Transportation Center (NADTC), a partnership between the Federal Transit Administration, Easterseals, and the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging, promotes transportation availability and accessibility for older adults, people with disabilities, and their caregivers. It offers training and webinars, and Resources & Publications that are available for download.

The National Rural Transit Assistance Program Directory of State RTAP Managers offers a searchable directory of state Rural Transit Assistance Program managers, and VirtualCAP provides information and resources used by Community Action Agencies to help people become self-sufficient in rural and urban areas.

427,What Is Telemental Health?,"What is Telemental Health?

Telemental health is the use of telecommunications or videoconferencing technology to provide mental health services. It is sometimes referred to as telepsychiatry or telepsychology. Research suggests that telemental health services can be effective for many people, including, but not limited to those with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety.

As the need for providing virtual mental health care services has increased, providers are finding ways to use phone and videoconferencing technology to bring therapy, evaluations, interventions, and medication management to individuals where they are.

Although the practice has become much more common, especially as a result of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, more research is needed to understand when and how telemental health services should be used.

431,Comfort Care for Kids and Their Families: A Mother's Story,"When Jake Swoyer was born in 1995, he seemed like any other healthy baby boy. His family—parents, John and Barbara Swoyer, and big brother Ryan, then 3— were thrilled.

But when Jake, who is from Sudbury, Massachusetts, was 7 months old, he had his first seizure. After that, ""he got very sick, very quickly,"" his mother says. His seizures came frequently and could last up to an hour. ""We had 23 ambulance rides in that first year.""

""I had no idea what palliative care really was or what it could do for us."" – Barbara Swoyer

Despite a lot of testing, doctors were unable to determine a cause for his seizures until Jake was nearly 10 years old, when a test revealed he had a genetic mutation associated with Dravet syndrome. Dravet syndrome is a lifelong, rare form of epilepsy that begins in the first year of life and typically doesn't respond to medication. Jake was also later diagnosed with mitochondrial dysfunction, adding to the severity and complexity of his disease.

Since he was diagnosed, Jake has suffered a long, slow, steady decline in his health, his mother says. Palliative care has made all the difference in how the family has coped with Jake's devastating condition and in helping Jake enjoy a good quality of life. He received pediatric palliative care support and services until he turned 21.

Finding palliative care

""When Jake was first diagnosed, our physician suggested enrolling him in palliative care. Like many families, my first thought was, 'Oh no, he thinks my son is dying.' I had no idea what palliative care really was or what it could do for us,"" Barbara recalls.

She finally took his suggestion after about a year. As Barbara worked with several different providers, ""a light bulb finally went off. I realized what palliative care was supposed to be,"" she says. ""Along with providing clinical and emotional support, the palliative team introduced comfort care measures. Jake was able to receive pet therapy for enjoyment, massage therapy for relaxation, and music therapy for active engagement and socialization. Each of these therapies brought joy and positive change into his daily life.""

Palliative care services also included a medical team to help with medical support and crisis management, Barbara says. ""They could come to the house, diagnose a problem, and prescribe and provide treatment. We didn't have to go to the hospital for every problem."" Having home-based medical support allowed the family to treat problems in their own home, which became especially important as Jake got older.

Embracing a difficult but important path

A chaplain and a social worker paid regular visits to the Swoyer home.

""In 25 years of caring for a child with limited life expectancy, these were two of the more meaningful and pivotal people I had the opportunity to work with,"" Barbara says. They were open to and encouraged philosophical discussion about Jake's eventual end of life.

""They helped us consider and define our goals of care,"" Barbara says. ""From these conversations, we felt at peace with past decisions and better equipped to make future decisions on Jake's behalf. It was a relief to have these discussions in periods of calm, rather than in moments of crisis.""

Barbara is a founding member of the Parent Advisory Board for Courageous Parents Network, a nonprofit organization that helps families and providers caring for children with serious illness. Her wish is for families to understand that palliative care is about helping a child live well in the face of life-threatening disease.

""It's about bringing happiness and comfort to a child, while also supporting the entire family unit, no matter where they are on their journey with serious illness,"" she says.

432,New Research on Palliative Care and COVID-19,"Jean Kutner, M.D., a professor of medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, is a well-known expert in palliative and hospice care. She is also a top researcher in the field. She says palliative care ""focuses on the whole person, addressing their spiritual, psychological, and medical needs along the whole course of their journey with a serious illness.""

This year, the COVID-19 pandemic has spotlighted the need for doctors and nurses trained in palliative care. Hospitals are treating thousands of seriously ill patients. Many of them may end up on life support with their families unable to be with them.

Dr. Kutner discussed how palliative care teams are helping patients and families during this time.

Doctors and nurses trained in palliative care have been in high demand during the pandemic. Has the crisis shown people how this kind of care can help patients and their families?

Yes, absolutely. At hospitals across the country, there has been increased demand for palliative care teams. They help overwhelmed families, patients, and hospital staff cope with this very serious illness. It has been especially hard for patients and families who have to be separated because the virus is so contagious. A palliative care team can support families that have to make difficult decisions. The pandemic has also shown the importance of having conversations about the goals of care—such as, do you want to be on a ventilator?—and documenting someone who can make medical decisions for a patient who is seriously ill or dying. This is also known as a health care proxy.

""A palliative care team can support families that have to make difficult decisions."" – Jean Kutner, M.D.

Much of the early research on the benefits of palliative care involved cancer patients. How is the scope of palliative care expanding?

It's true that palliative care had its roots in helping people with cancer. In the last five-plus years, there has been more work with people who have Parkinson's, ALS, heart failure, lung diseases like COPD, advanced kidney disease, and dementia. These groups have different needs than cancer patients. There's also been exciting research supporting children and adolescents with progressive, life-limiting illness.

Can you tell us about the NIH-funded research you are involved in?

I am the lead researcher in a large national project funded by the National Institute of Nursing Research on providing training for other palliative care researchers. I'm also doing research on training palliative care providers to help families with the most difficult conversations regarding a family member's health.

Until recently, people may not have heard of palliative care or confused it with hospice care. Is that changing?

When I gave talks to public groups about palliative care 10 years ago, I often would get blank stares. But that is changing. More people have heard of it. There is also a growing number of patient and provider groups who are huge advocates of it. I especially see that among our nursing and medical school students, even clinical psychology students. When I do interviews for residency programs in internal medicine, the students ask about rotations in palliative care. They feel it's important. This generation of trainees is truly going to change this field.",magazine.medlineplus.gov

435,If You're about to Become a Cancer Caregiver,"If You’re About to Become a Cancer Caregiver

Caregiver is defined here as the person who most often helps the person with cancer and is not paid to do so. In most cases, the main (primary) caregiver is a spouse, partner, parent, or an adult child. When family is not around, close friends, co-workers, or neighbors may fill this role. The caregiver has a key role in the patient’s care. Good, reliable caregiver support is crucial to the physical and emotional well-being of people with cancer.

Today, most cancer treatment is given in outpatient treatment centers – not in hospitals. This means someone is needed to be part of the day-to-day care of the person with cancer and that sicker people are being cared for at home. As a result, caregivers have many roles. These roles change as the patient’s needs change during and after cancer treatment.

Caregivers serve as home health aides and companions. They may help feed, dress, and bathe the patient. Caregivers arrange schedules, manage insurance issues, and provide transportation. They are legal assistants, financial managers, and housekeepers. They often have to take over the duties of the person with cancer, and still meet the needs of other family members.

On top of the normal day-to-day tasks, such as meals, cleaning, and driving or arranging transportation, as a caregiver, you’ll also become an important part of the cancer care team. This busy schedule could leave you with no time to take care of your own needs. You also may feel the need to turn down job opportunities, work fewer hours, or even retire early to meet the demands of being a caregiver.

Here are some things to think about if you are about to become a caregiver for a person with cancer.

What does it feel like to be a caregiver?

Despite the sadness and shock of having a loved one with cancer, many people find personal satisfaction in caring for that person. You may see it as a meaningful role that allows you to show your love and respect for the person. It may also feel good to be helpful and know that you’re needed by a loved one.

You might find that caregiving enriches your life. You might feel a deep sense of satisfaction, confidence, and accomplishment in caring for someone. You may also learn about inner strengths and abilities that you didn’t even know you had, and find a greater sense of purpose for your own life.

The caregiving role can open up doors to new friends and relationships, too. Through a support group, you can get to know people who have faced the same kinds of problems. Caregiving can also draw families together and help people feel closer to the person who needs care.

Caregiving can also be frustrating and painful. People caring for very sick patients may notice their own feelings of severe sadness and emotional distress. They may feel sadness and grief over their loved one’s illness and may also feel overwhelmed or frustrated as they try to manage many difficult problems.

Caregivers can develop physical symptoms, like tiredness and trouble sleeping. This is more likely to be a problem for caregivers who aren’t able to get the support they need, and who don’t take care of themselves – especially those who try to press forward alone, even as their own quality of life suffers.

Caring for someone going through cancer treatment can be demanding, but being good at it can give you a sense of meaning and pride. These good feelings can help provide the strength and endurance to continue in the role for as long as needed.

What if you don't want to be the caregiver?

It’s quite normal to feel overwhelmed, burdened, and even trapped at times while caregiving. If your family has had troubled relationships in the past, you may wonder “why me?” You may feel that the caregiver role was dumped on you without your consent. You may feel unprepared or even unable to manage the responsibilities and feelings that go with it. You may feel pressure from family members, friends, and members of the cancer care team to provide care, despite having little or no desire or ability to do so.

If you became a caregiver because of other people’s wishes, you need to think about how you feel about being pressured into caregiving. Mixed feelings at the onset of this role can lead to a greater sense of frustration later on. You should decide on your limits and make them known as soon as you can – before the demands of caregiving become a problem. It’s not easy to do this when others resist the change, and it can take a lot of courage to do it. If you know you’re going to meet with resistance, talk with the patient’s team social worker first. Or you can ask their doctor about a referral so you can talk with someone about the caregiver problem.

Addressing the problems early can help you and the patient get the help you need, and if you have to, make other plans for care. In situations like this, it might be helpful to find someone to help you with caregiving so that you know from the start that the role will be shared. It also may be better to find someone else to act as the primary (main) caregiver.

You’ll need to take care of yourself, too

It’s hard to plan for a major health problem like cancer. Suddenly you’ve been asked to care for the person with cancer, and you’re also needed to help make decisions about medical care and treatment. None of this is easy. There will be times when you know you’ve done well, and times when you just want to give up. This is normal.

There are many causes of stress and distress in cancer caregivers. Dealing with the crisis of cancer in someone you love, the uncertain future, financial worries, difficult decisions, and unexpected and unwanted lifestyle changes are just a few of them. Fear, hopelessness, guilt, confusion, doubt, anger, and helplessness can take a toll on both the person with cancer and the caregiver. And while the focus tends to be on the patient, all of this will affect your physical and mental health, too.

Depression

Depression is common in caregivers. But caregiving does not always cause depression and not all caregivers have the difficult emotions that go with depression. Everyone has emotional ups and downs, but if a person always feels down, has no energy, cries a lot, or is easily angered, it may be a warning sign of depression.

Many people see the feelings of depression as a sign of weakness rather than a sign that something is out of balance, but ignoring or denying these feelings won’t make them go away. Early attention to symptoms of depression can make a big difference in how the caregiver feels about their role and how well they can do the things they need to do.

There are ways to help reduce stress and remind you to enjoy life. They might help prevent a more serious depression that can develop over time:

Support from family and friends in caring for the patient

Exercise

A healthy diet

Spiritual support, such as religious activity, prayer, journaling, or meditation

Recreational time, when you can enjoy friends socially

Help from a trained mental health professional

But caregivers often focus on the person with cancer and don’t take care of themselves. You may be a caregiver, but you still have your own needs that cannot and should not be put aside.

Plan things that you enjoy

There are 3 types of activities that you need to do for yourself:

Those that involve other people, such as having lunch with a friend.

Those that give you a sense of accomplishment, like exercising or finishing a project.

Those that make you feel good or relaxed, like watching a funny movie or taking a walk.

Make an effort to notice and talk about things you do as they happen during the day. Watch the news or take time to read the morning paper. Set aside time during the day, like during a meal, when you do not talk about illness.

Getting professional help if you think you need it

It’s normal to feel overwhelmed sometimes by caregiver responsibilities. But if it becomes a constant problem, you may need to see a mental health professional. Below is a list of serious signs of trouble. Get professional help if you:

Feel depressed, physically sick, or hopeless

Feel like hurting yourself or hurting or yelling at the people you care for

Depend too heavily on alcohol or recreational drugs

Fight with your spouse, children, stepchildren, or other family members and friends

Are no longer taking care of yourself

Take a break or time for yourself

Most caregivers hesitate to take a break from their caregiving responsibilities, even for a short time. In fact, most would probably feel guilty if they did this. But no one can be a caregiver every day, 24 hours a day, for many months and even years. Try to get out of the house and away from your loved one every day – even if it’s only to take a short walk or shop for food. If you can’t leave the patient alone and don’t have friends or family to relieve you, you might want to look into getting help from respite caregivers.

Respite care

Respite care is the term used to describe short-term, temporary relief for those who are caring for family members who might otherwise need professional care. Respite is a short break from the exhausting challenges of being a caregiver. It’s been shown to help keep family caregivers healthy and improve their sense of well-being.

In most cases, the respite caregiver comes to the home and gets to know the patient, the family routine, and things like where medicines are stored. Sitter-companion services are one respite option. This is sometimes offered by local civic groups, church or religious groups, and other community organizations. A regular sitter-companion can provide friendly respite care for a few hours, once or twice a week. Be sure that the sitter-companion knows what to do if there’s an emergency while the caregiver is gone.

Another type of respite uses a specialized, local facility where the patient may stay for a few days or even a few weeks. This gives the caregiver a chance to take a vacation from caregiving and catch their breath, whether or not they leave town.

Depending on your state, Medicaid or Medicare may help cover respite costs. Also check with the patient’s health insurance to see what kind of respite help might be offered.

Know what you can’t do

Most importantly, don’t try to do it all yourself. Caregiving alone for any period of time is not realistic. Reach out to others. Involve them in your life and in the things you must do for your loved one.

Some caregivers feel they have to do it all alone. They may believe that, as the partner, sibling, son, or daughter they’re responsible for the sick loved one. It’s painful for them to admit that they can’t do it all and still keep their own health and sanity. They’ll bend over backward to meet their loved one’s every need. Some feel guilty if they can’t do it all and say they feel “selfish” if they ask for help.

Set realistic limits on what you can do. For instance, if you have a back injury, and/or if your loved one is too big for you to lift, you may be able to help them roll over in bed, but don’t try to lift them alone or catch them when they fall. (You may end up seriously injured or sick and become unable to help anyone.) There are ways you can safely help a person sit up or walk but you have to learn to do it without hurting yourself. This is where expert help is needed – home care nurses or physical therapists can show you how to do it safely. They can also help you get special equipment, if needed.

Your own health and safety must come first if you want to keep helping your loved one.

When you need help, reach out to others, including professionals. Talk with the cancer care team about what you’re doing and where you need help. Involve them in your life and your loved one’s care.

Finding support for yourself

The support of friends and family is key to both the person with cancer and the caregiver. There are many kinds of support programs, including one-on-one or group counseling and support groups. A support group can be a powerful tool for both people with cancer and those who care about them. Talking with others who are in situations like yours can help ease loneliness. You can also get useful ideas from others that might help you.

Talk with a nurse or social worker or contact your local American Cancer Society to learn about services in your area. Talking with other caregivers can help you feel less alone. If you can’t visit a group in person, the American Cancer Society has the Cancer Survivors Network (CSN), an online community of people whose lives have been touched by cancer. Other organizations have internet-based groups and even online counseling, too. Through online or in person support groups, people can share their stories, offer practical advice, and support each other through shared experiences.

Religion can be a source of strength for some people. Some members of the clergy are specially trained to help people with cancer and their families. People who are not religious may find spiritual support in other ways. Meditation, journaling, and being outside in nature are examples of different ways a person may feel they’re part of something greater than themselves.

Ask others to help

Caregivers need a range of support services to stay healthy, be good caregivers, and stay in the caregiving role. But they often don’t know where to go for help or how to accept help.

Caregivers have been shown to have less distress and feel less burdened when they have social support. Human connections can help you stay strong. Let people know what you need and ask for help. You cannot and should not try to be responsible for all the caregiving by yourself.

You need to know who you can talk to and count on for help. Families facing cancer can become stronger. If family members don’t offer help, or if you need more help than they can give you, you may be able to set up a circle of friends to help you. Church members, neighbors, and others may be willing to help. Include them in “family meetings.” Share information with them on the patient’s condition, needs, and care.

Allowing others to help can take some of the pressure off and give you time to take care of yourself. Often family and friends want to help but may not know how or what you need. Here are some tips for including family and friends:

Look for situations where you need help. Make a list or note them on a calendar.

Hold regular family meetings to keep everyone involved. Use these meetings as updates and care-planning sessions. Include the patient.

Ask family and friends when they can help and what jobs they think they can do. You may also contact a person with a certain request. Be very clear about what you need.

As you hear back from each person, note it on your list to make sure they have taken care of what you needed.

There are many online resources that can help you manage your job as caregiver. Some sites offer support for people caring for a loved one who has cancer. Other sites have features like group calendars to organize helpers and areas to create personal websites that concerned people can access for updates. . Some of these also allow others to sign up for specific tasks when help is needed. Taking full advantage of the resources available to you is another way you can take care of yourself.

Caring for your children during this time

If you have young children, you’ll need to figure out how to take care of them and their needs while you’re caring for the person with cancer. Juggling children’s schedules and trying to keep their lives as normal as possible often requires a great deal more help from friends and family members. As you’re setting up care for the person with cancer, you might also need to tap into other parents and trusted friends and neighbors for help with your children.

Children can sense stress in their family members and notice that there’s less time for them. They may start to have trouble in school or act like they did when they were younger. Even though your time is limited, you’ll need to take time to check in with them to learn about their fears and concerns.

Being a caregiver and keeping your job

Caregiving itself can be a full-time job, but many caregivers already have paying jobs. This can lead to work-related issues like missed days, low productivity, and work interruptions. Some caregivers even need to take unpaid leave, turn down promotions, or lose work benefits. The stress of caring for someone on top of worrying about keeping your job can be overwhelming. Dealing with these issues is important to both the employer and the employee.

There will be times when there will be more demands on the caregiver, for instance, when the patient is diagnosed, getting cancer treatment, getting treatment for recurrence, or nearing the end of life. The employed caregiver may end up having to take time off from their paying job for caregiving.

For people in certain types of jobs (temps, freelancers, consultants, entrepreneurs), this is very difficult. If they don’t work, they don’t get paid. For those with traditional jobs in larger companies, there may be benefits to help you take time off and still keep your job.

Some people find that there’s no one else to care for the cancer patient on a long-term basis, and cut back to working part time. Some feel that they have to quit their jobs entirely. If you need to keep your job but the interruptions and time off are creating problems, you might want to look into a different schedule to fit the times your loved one needs you most. Some companies allow you to take some paid leave if you are caring for a spouse or close relative. You might be able to work half-days or split shifts, or take one day a week off for doctor visits, for example.

If you need some time away from work, speak with your boss or benefits office. If your workplace has an Employee Assistance Program, look into what it offers. Some offer counseling services for money concerns, stress, and depression.

The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) guarantees up to 12 weeks off per year to take care of a seriously ill family member (spouse, parent, or child). It only applies to larger companies, and not every employee qualifies for it. If you can’t or don’t want to stop working, you might be able to take unpaid time off under the FMLA.

You may find that the people you work with treat you differently because of the time you must spend on caregiving tasks. This can affect you personally, as well as financially.

Keeping your health insurance if you have to quit your job

When caregivers quit their jobs, they usually lose their employer’s health insurance coverage as well as their source of income. It’s very important for you still to have some type of health care coverage. If you’re able to pay for your own insurance, COBRA will allow you to be covered for some months after you leave your job. Another option might be insurance from the Health Insurance Marketplace.

If you make mistakes

No matter what you do, you will very likely come to a point where you feel that you’ve failed in some way. It seems obvious that as a caregiver, you do the best you can. You try to include the patient, other concerned family members, and close friends in important discussions. You always try to make decisions that are in the patient’s best interest – decisions that you and the patient can live with. But sometimes you’ll feel that you could have handled a situation better or done something a better way.

At these times, it’s important not to blame yourself. Find a way to forgive yourself and move on. It helps to keep in mind that you will keep making mistakes, just like everyone else. Try to keep a sense of humor about it. And try to recognize those things that you do well, too. These things are often easy to overlook. It also helps to keep in mind why you chose to take on this often difficult and stressful job.

436,COVID-19 Vaccine Considerations for People with Disabilities,"What People with Disabilities and Care Providers Need to Know About COVID-19 Vaccines

This webpage provides information for people with disabilities or conditions that may increase their risk of getting and spreading COVID-19, and for their care providers. If you do not see the information you need, please check the CDC COVID-19 Vaccine Information page.

Information on COVID-19 vaccines is updated regularly. Check back for updated information.

Get a COVID-19 vaccine

Vaccines are now available to help protect you from getting COVID-19. Disability alone does not put you at higher risk for getting COVID-19. You may be at higher risk because of where you live, such as a long-term care home. You may be at risk because you need to have close contact with care providers. You may also be at risk because you have difficulty wearing a mask, staying at least 6 feet away from other people, or washing your hands.

Many people with disabilities have diabetes, cancer, heart disease, or obesity. These conditions may put you at higher risk of severe illness due to COVID-19. Talk to your doctor about your health conditions that may put you at higher risk for getting very sick from COVID-19 and about getting a COVID-19 vaccine.

Down Syndrome is one condition that may put you at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19. You might wonder why your disability is not on the underlying conditions list. Conditions are added when there is enough scientific evidence to support putting them on the list. The list is updated as new information becomes available. Please check back often for updates.

Take steps to prevent getting and spreading COVID-19.

When to get your COVID-19 vaccine

It is important that people with disabilities get the COVID-19 vaccine. Everyone 16 years of age and older is now eligible to get a COVID-19 vaccination. Get a COVID-19 vaccine as soon as you can. Widespread vaccination is a critical tool to help stop the pandemic.

How to get a COVID-19 vaccine for my care provider

You might have someone who helps you with your day-to-day activities, such as a care provider. Care providers may be considered essential workers in vaccination plans. Hospice, home healthcare, and group home providers are considered essential workers. Some examples of home healthcare providers are skilled nurses and therapists and other people who provide personal care services in the home.

A parent or family member might help you with your day-to-day activities. People who help you with your care might be able to get the COVID-19 vaccine at the same time as you do, depending on what state they live in. Your family member or care provider can contact the health department in the state they live in to find out if they can get the COVID-19 vaccine when you do.

What to expect after your vaccination

You may have mild side effects, like pain, redness, or swelling on the arm, or tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, fever or nausea. These side effects are normal and can last a few days. If you get the COVID-19 vaccine and have side effects that do not go away in a few days or have more serious symptoms, call your doctor.

With some COVID-19 vaccines, you will need 2 shots to be fully protected. The timing between your first and second shot depends on which vaccine you received. You should get your second shot as close to the recommended interval as possible. Learn which COVID-19 vaccines need two shots.

After you are fully vaccinated for COVID-19, you may be able to start doing some things that you had stopped doing because of the pandemic. Learn more about what you can do when you have been fully vaccinated.

Research shows that COVID-19 vaccine is safe for people 16 years of age and older. Call your doctor if you have questions or concerns about COVID-19 vaccine.

How to access materials about COVID-19

CDC is working to make COVID-19 resources accessible for everyone. We have resources about COVID-19 that are easy to read. We have resources for people with limited English. We also have resources in American Sign Language.

442,Biomarkers Identified in Collegiate Athletes That Could Help Predict Time Needed to Recover From Concussion,"Biomarkers identified in collegiate athletes that could help predict time needed to recover from concussion

What

A collaborative study conducted by scientists from the National Institutes of Health, Department of Defense (DOD), and multiple academic institutions has identified blood biomarkers that could help to predict which athletes need additional time to recover from a sports related concussion. This collaboration, known as the Concussion Assessment, Research, and Education (CARE) consortium, is supported, in part, by DOD and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).

In this study, conducted at several sites across the U.S., 127 male and female collegiate athletes who had sustained a sports-related concussion were tested at several time points: shortly after injury, when their symptoms resolved, and one week after returning to play. Each athlete had also undergone preseason, baseline testing.

Using an ultrasensitive assay that can detect minute amounts of protein, the researchers tested blood serum from these athletes and identified two blood proteins that were associated with the length of time needed by the athletes to return to play. Amounts of these two proteins, tau protein and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were found to be significantly different in athletes who needed less or more than 14 days to return. While further research is needed, the results of this study are an important step towards the development of a test that could help predict which athletes need more time to recover from a concussion and resume activity.

This study was published in JAMA Network Open.

444,Measuring Blood Pressure,"What do the results mean?

Your results, also known as a blood pressure reading, will contain two numbers. The top or first number is the systolic pressure. The bottom or second number is the diastolic pressure. High blood pressure readings are also labeled by categories, ranging from normal to crisis. Your reading may show your blood pressure is:

Blood Pressure Category Systolic Blood Pressure

Diastolic Blood Pressure Normal Less than 120 and Less than 80 High Blood Pressure (no other heart risk factors) 140 or higher or 90 or higher High Blood Pressure (with other heart risk factors, according to some providers) 130 or higher or 80 or higher Dangerously high blood pressure - seek medical care right away 180 or higher and 120 or higher

If you've been diagnosed with high blood pressure, your provider may recommend lifestyle changes and/or medicines to control your blood pressure. Your provider may also recommend that you regularly check your blood pressure at home with an automated blood pressure monitor. An at-home blood pressure monitor usually includes a blood pressure cuff and a digital device to record and display blood pressure readings.

Home monitoring is not a replacement for regular visits to your provider. But it can provide important information, such as whether treatment is working or your condition may have worsened. Also, home monitoring may make the test less stressful. Many people get nervous about getting their blood pressure taken at a provider's office. This is called ""white coat syndrome."" It can cause a temporary rise in blood pressure, making the results less accurate. For more information about home monitoring of blood pressure, talk to your provider.

If you were tested for low blood pressure, a blood pressure reading of 90 systolic, 60 diastolic (90/60) or lower is considered abnormal. Treatments for low blood pressure may include medicines and making certain changes to your diet.",medlineplus.gov

The added investments value the New York-based startup at more than $1 billion, Capsule CEO Eric Kinariwala said in an interview. This, plus Capsule’s past raises, brings its total funding to date to $570 million.

The funds will go towards market expansion and technology updates, Bloomberg reported.

Caresyntax, a digital surgery platform, has closed a $100 million Series C funding round led by PFM Health Sciences LP.

New investors Optum Ventures, Intel Capital, Lauxera Capital Partners, Vesalius Biocapital III, Arno Capital, Rezayat Investments, as well as existing investors IPF Partners, the Relyens Group and Surgical.AI also participated in the raise.

The company’s platform utilizes artificial intelligence and real-world data from the operating room to provide actionable insights to the care team. It can also connect surgeons with outside experts, such as medical school instructors or medical device representatives, in real-time.

""Operating rooms need to perform as effectively and efficiently as possible, and this is especially true now to make up for the surgical backlog driven by the pandemic,"" Dennis Kogan, the founder and CEO of Caresyntax, said in a statement. ""With better technology to safely automate surgical pathways while generating decision-grade real-world evidence, we will improve health care decision-making, mitigate surgical risks, and advance high-value medical technology.""

The funding will be used to accelerate Caresyntax’s growth, conduct research and development for its AI technology, expand its platform, and add to its employee base.

Direct-payment healthcare marketplace Sesame has added $24 million in new funding. Investments from new backers included Giant Ventures, Industry Ventures and Coefficient Capital, in addition to existing investors General Catalyst, Entree Capital and Atreides Management.

Using Sesame’s platform, patients can directly pay providers for a range of in-person or online care, including urgent care, sexual health and mental health.

The funds will support Sesame’s nationwide telehealth expansion and allow it to expand the scope of its in-person offerings.

“Only radical simplicity will fix a complex system like healthcare,” Sesame CEO and cofounder David Goldhill said in a statement. “Right now, the healthcare industry works really well if you’re an insurance company or a hospital. But not if you’re a patient or a doctor. We’re changing that every single time a patient finds, books, and pays for care directly on Sesame.”

""We look forward to partnering with and supporting the vision of forward-thinking public safety leaders looking to drive innovation across 9-1-1.""

MD Ally has raised $4.5 million to date with these new investments.

Votive Health officially launched today following the completion of a $2.5 million raise led by Flare Capital Partners, with Chrysalis Ventures and OCA Ventures as additional participants.

The company plans to use its technology platform to coordinate value-based arrangements between payers and providers to deliver at-home care for people dealing with life-threatening illnesses, according to the announcement.

""Too often patients facing a serious illness receive unnecessary and expensive services that don't meet their physical, social, or existential needs, and which add to the financial stress and burden on the family,"" Torrie Fields, the founder and CEO of Votive Health, said in a statement.

""Patients don't get the personalized care they need, while costs to payers and providers continue to grow. We're solving that disconnect by bringing complex care home.""

446,IVF is complicated. AI companies are looking to help ,"People in the U.S. are waiting longer to have babies. And more and more families are seeking help with getting pregnant. In fact, according to Penn Medicine, one million babies have been born between 1987 and 2015 using in vitro fertilization or other assisted technology.

But IVF success rates remain relatively low. There is a 21.3% chance of full-term normal birth weight and singleton live birth per assisted reproductive technology cycle, Penn Medicine states.

However, innovators are looking to artificial intelligence to help boost these numbers and help people have genetically healthy babies. The new technology is also expected to help cut down on the cost of invasive procedures.

AI is certainly the next big wave of, I wouldn't call it disruption, but I would call it advancement in the fertility sector,"" Presagen founder and CEO Dr. Michelle Perugini told MobiHealthNews. ""It's really going to improve success rates for patients. It's going to create great efficiency in the lab environment and also standardization of what is currently a quite subjective process.""

Presagen's fertility-focused branch Life Whisperer is working on new technology aimed at helping doctors find the patient's genetically healthy embryos.

""This new product is called Life Whisperer Genetics. We are so excited about it,"" Perugini said. ""Essentially without biopsying an embryo, we can assess the likelihood of it being genetically normal or genetically abnormal just through using artificial intelligence and the images of the embryos.""

The latest tech runs on AWS, which allows it to scale and figure out HIPAA compliance. Typically, PGT-A genetic testing requires a portion of healthy embryos to be removed for future testing.

""We're conducting a study using our AI, and the study was done on around 91,500 stimulated patient cohorts. There was around 1,000 embryos in those cohorts,"" Perugini said. ""Then we used the AI to rank the embryos to see how often they could get the normal embryos right up to the top because what you want to do is select the most genetically normal embryos each time. It was able to rank the most normal embryos [at the] top about 82% of the time. And within the top 2, it was able to arrange it around 96% of the time. So really good accuracy. It's super exciting.""

Life Whisperer previously developed a tool called Life Whisperer Viability, which uses AI for embryo assessment during the IVF process. The tool was designed to help predict which embryo will lead to implantation or not using a single image of the embryo.

Perugini said tools like these can help cut down on the costs associated with fertility practices and boost the chances of having a genetically healthy baby.

""What we are doing is putting evidence-based and objectivity to some of the decisions being made in the IVF process. And in particular, we are working on the embryo selection process, so obviously during the IVF selecting the healthiest embryo is critical to a successful pregnancy outcome,"" she said. ""How that is done now is through risky and invasive processes like PGT-A or through subjective processes like embryo grading. Both of those can be improved with AI.""

Presagen isn't the only company working in the space. This morning, Israeli company AiVF landed a European CE mark for its AI-based digital embryology management platform EMA.

The company's new platform was developed to help integrate AI, computer vision and big data. It also has a genetic evaluation tool designed to detect if an embryo is genetically suitable for transfer without a biopsy.

“Some 30% of all IVF treatments take place in Europe, and clinics have difficulty meeting the demand for treatment,” Daniella Gilboa, AiVF’s cofounder and CEO, said in a statement. “AiVF’s unique solution has created an automated lab that, through its remarkable digital capabilities, is able to perform many of the embryologist's tasks rapidly, accurately and objectively.”

Another Israeli company called Embryonics is also looking into the fertility space. This company is currently focused on using AI to improve the odds of successfully implanting an embryo during IVF.

In July 2020, the company presented a peer-reviewed study at the Medical Imaging with Deep Learning conference in Montreal. Technology was developed on a curated data set from tens of thousands of IVF cycles, including time-lapse videos of embryos.

Perugini said AI is scalable in a way that some of the biopsying is not. She said her company is looking to take the product globally – into the U.S., Europe, India and beyond.

""I think for patients what they are looking for is transparency in their treatment,"" she said. ""They are looking for more science. They are looking for more evidence and structure around decisions being made for them in the clinical environment. It doesn't in any way replace the embryologist. It's just really adding value. It's helping the embryologist to be more accurate at what they do.""",www.mobihealthnews.com
447,Cigna members can now tap into mental health services via Ginger app ,"On-demand behavioral health platform Ginger is now available as a health benefit for Cigna’s 14 million members, the companies announced today.

Members with Cigna’s employer-sponsored or individual and family insurance plans can now access Ginger’s behavioral health coaching, therapy and psychiatry services as an in-network benefit.

“Cigna's mission is to improve the health, well-being and peace of mind of those we serve by making healthcare simple, affordable and predictable,” Dr. Doug Nemecek, the chief medical officer for behavioral health at Cigna, said in a statement.

450,Going paperless: Emirates begins digital verification of COVID-19 medical records,"The largest airline in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is now in the process of implementing paperless document verification relating to COVID-19 PCR testing and vaccination.

This week, Emirates announced it is working with the Dubai Health Authority (DHA) to allow for digital verification of travellers’ data, resulting in a more secure and efficient procedure.

Rather than producing a paper copy of their PCR test at check-in, UAE-based passengers will now have their results and vaccination history – provided they were vaccinated at a DHA clinic – synchronised electronically with their flight details. The airline claims that “the integration makes Dubai one of the first cities in the world to implement full digital verification of [COVID-19] traveller medical records.”

Kleitham Ali Al Shamsi, Director of IT at the DHA added: “This partnership reinforces that technology has the potential to securely, conveniently and effectively assist airlines to receive the verified COVID-19 test results and vaccination records.

“From the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, DHA has worked tirelessly to connect all the laboratories that process COVID-19 test results in Dubai into DHA’s Outbreak Management system, this integration has been instrumental today to help develop such a unique integration with Emirates Airline.”

Those who have conducted PCR testing or have taken a vaccine outside of Dubai, however, will still be required to provide hard copies of their travel documents at check-in.

WHY IT MATTERS

With more incidences of PCR test forgery coming to light, it makes sense to streamline data, allowing for airlines to check test results through a central system governed by the country’s health authority.

In February, for example, the DHA changed requirements for PCR testing for some territories, stating that tests must now have a QR code linking to an original test report.

As per the new strategy, Emirates confirmed that customer data will not be saved following completion of a flight.

“Emirates will only process the relevant information specifically related to the COVID-19 entry requirements of the customer’s destination,” it said in a statement. “Once check-in formalities are completed, information related to COVID-19 medical records will be immediately discarded from the Emirates systems.”

In the coming months, the next phase of its digital verification will see secure integration of health records within the IATA Travel Pass as another option to help facilitate travel.

ON THE RECORD

“The DHA has been strongly foraying into paperless healthcare over the past few years to enhance patient convenience and further improve healthcare delivery,” said Ahmed Al Nuaimi, CEO of DHA’s Joint Corporate Support Services. “Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have deployed and fostered the use of digital healthcare.

“The strategic foresight into investing in digital healthcare has paved the way today for such a pioneering integration. This partnership will directly help streamline and make travel easy and convenient as well as ensure validation of all necessary COVID-19 medical records.”

Adel Al Redha, Emirates COO added: “The UAE government has been very supportive and is one of the leading countries in the use of technology and digital applications. This initiative is in line with the government’s vision and we are delighted to take this step within the aviation sector to cooperate with DHA in linking our systems together to enhance the customer experience by processing the relevant documents in a more efficient, secure and effective manner.

“Our partnership with the DHA in managing passenger travel is unique and is a first step towards other initiatives that will be launched in the near future. This is a testament to Dubai’s progressive approach in delivering innovative digital solutions across all aspects of services.”",www.mobihealthnews.com
451,YouTube COVID-19 PSA aims to inform young people about vaccine facts,"YouTube is pairing health experts up with an array of celebrities to talk about COVID-19 vaccines as part of its new public service announcement. This new PSA is born out of a collaboration between YouTube, the Vaccine Confidence Project and the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, and it's focused on providing people with reliable information about COVID-19 immunizations.

Google's video platform will focus on giving users information about how the vaccine was developed and tested – and what users can expect post-vaccination. As part of the new initiative, the company will run videos on its own platform, paid TV, radio and social media through July.

""Hearing inaccurate information can breed doubt in someone’s mind, and that’s why trusted scientific and medical organizations are partnering with YouTube to make sure credible information is reaching people in accessible and culturally relevant ways,"" Dr. Garth Graham, director and global head of Healthcare and Public Partnerships at YouTube, wrote in a blog post.

According to YouTube, the PSA will zero in on the 18 to 34 demographic. Graham said the PSA will highlight ""diverse voices who bring unique perspectives and experiences."" For example, the company pairs up Grammy Award-winning artist MONICA with White House Chief Medical Advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci to talk about vaccines and COVID-19.

THE LARGER TREND

While the COVID-19 vaccines roll out across the country, there is still a great deal of hesitancy. According to the Kaiser Family Fund COVID-19 Vaccine Monitor, 61% of adults over the age of 18 want to get the vaccine ASAP or have already had the shot. That number is lower among 18- to 24-year-olds (49%) and 30- to 49-year-olds (54%). Individuals over age 65 were the ones most likely to report wanting the vaccine or already having it, at 82%.

The research also found some discrepancies across demographics. The data showed that 64% of white people, 61% of Hispanics and 55% of Black Americans wanting the vaccine ASAP or already having the vaccine. Democrats were also more likely to want the vaccine than Republicans or Independents. However, Suburban and Rural dwellers reported the same amount of hesitancy.

To date, 231 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered, according to the CDC. In fact, 42.5% of the total population has received at least one dose, and 28.9% have been fully vaccinated. However, COVID-19 is far from eradicated.

The CDC has reported on 380,840 cases within the last seven days. Since the virus began, there have been more than 31 million cases and 569,272 deaths in the U.S.

THE LARGER TREND

This isn't the first time big tech has been involved with public health initiatives and education. In 2021 Google, Facebook and Apple began to connect users to a COVID-19 Vaccine Finder tool.

Health is a new focus for YouTube. In January, the company announced a new team aimed at pushing for more high-quality, credible medical content on its platform, including content aimed at laypeople as well as physicians.

The team is led by Graham, who is the former U.S Deputy Assistant Secretary of Health.

ON THE RECORD

""Younger people around the world are key to the success of global vaccine programs. But, given the lower burden of disease this group has faced, they may be less motivated to get vaccinated,"" Heidi Larson, director of the Vaccine Confidence Project, said in a statement.

452,Insulin management company Glytec scores $21M to fuel growth ,"Glytec, an insulin management software company, has received $21 million in funding from Silicon Valley Bank, Savitr Capital and other private investors.

The company collected $9 million in debt financing from SVB and $12 million in equity investments led by Savitr positions, according to its announcement.

WHAT IT DOES

Glytec’s eGlycemic Management System is centered on its FDA-cleared Glucommander algorithm. The algorithm uses real-time and historical patient data to personalize insulin dosing by learning each patient’s insulin sensitivity and estimating future needs.

In addition to the personalized insulin dosing, the eGMS dashboard for providers includes glycemic management analytics, continuous surveillance of blood glucose levels and automated reminders for blood glucose checks.

The eGMS has been researched in more than 90 studies that demonstrate it can reduce low blood sugar by 99.8%, 30-day readmissions by 36-68% and length of stay by up to 3.2 days, the company said.

WHAT IT’S FOR

The investments will go towards growing Glytec’s team, specifically across the engineering and product departments. It plans to grow in size by more than 30% in 2021 to help scale the eGMS.

Additionally, the company will use the funds to improve the eGMS through simplifying provider workflows, enhancing analytic and reporting capability and further integrating into EHRs, mobile apps and other diabetes technologies.

MARKET SNAPSHOT

Earlier this month, Glytec released its latest version of the eGMS that includes medication-dose confirmation capabilities and overnight blood glucose level evaluations.

The diabetes space has no shortage of digital health companies developing solutions to manage the chronic condition.

Those who made headlines over the past few months include:

Onduo Health for expanding its platform to include hypertension, pre-diabetes, weight loss and mental wellbeing.

Better Therapeutics for announcing its public exit strategy with special purpose acquisition company Mountain Crest Acquisition Corp II.

Roche for integrating with Novo Nordisk's connected insulin pens.

The space is also well-funded. In March, Glooko announced a $30 million Series D funding round in order to boost the adoption of its platform, broaden the commercialization of its products in clinical research and push into new therapeutic areas.

Last week, Virta Health scored $133 million in a Series E funding round to grow its platform and reach more patients.

ON THE RECORD

“Hospitals have always been structured to treat acute conditions, and providers generally segment and focus on what they deem is most critical for each patient, with limited collaboration across disciplines. This approach doesn’t account for the fact that a patient’s blood glucose is an underlying factor that impacts nearly every condition in every department of the hospital,” Ed Furlong, the president and CEO of Glytec, said in a statement.

“With a growing shortage of endocrinologists, there’s no way they can scale to be at every bedside. Glucommander’s personalized-dosing decision support helps [it] scale efforts. With the funding from SVB and Savitr, and the exceptional support we’re getting from their teams, we’re ready to help more hospitals improve outcomes, and the patient care they provide.”",www.mobihealthnews.com
453,MindRhythm launches multicenter clinical trial to research stroke triage ,"MindRhythm, a new stroke-triage company launching today, has announced the beginning of its multicenter clinical trial to test the effectiveness of its stroke-detecting technology.

The study is being conducted by Wayne State University in partnership with Detroit Receiving Hospital, Henry Ford Hospital, Sinai-Grace Hospital and Ascension St. John Hospital. It will research MindRhythm’s flagship product, Harmony, in helping emergency responders detect Large Vessel Occlusion (LVO) strokes in order to triage patients to a hospital that can treat them.

“We are incredibly excited to now be enrolling patients in the MindRhythm trial,” Dr. James Paxton, a research director at Wayne State University, said in a statement.

“MindRhythm’s technology has the potential to save lives and change the course of stroke triage. We plan to hit the ground running in order to validate the effectiveness of MindRhythm through the multicenter clinical trial to help reduce the severity of neurological injury caused by LVO strokes.”

The Harmony device is a sensor-equipped headband designed to be used by emergency medical technicians. It can detect changes in brain vibrations, an indicator of LVO strokes, according to MindRhythm. Once EMTs get the diagnostic results, they can transport patients to the appropriate care location, all while sending GPS location updates and patient data to the hospital with Harmony.

WHY IT MATTERS

More than 795,000 people in the U.S. have a stroke every year and roughly 150,000 of those result in death, making it the fifth leading cause of death, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Most are ischemic strokes, where blood flow to the brain is blocked. LVO strokes are a particularly dangerous form of ischemic stroke due to a lack of prehospital diagnostic tools, and because only certain hospitals have the necessary equipment to treat them, according to Stroke.

These treatment deficits can result in delayed care. LVO strokes are therefore even more threatening, because timely medical care is vital for minimizing the long-term effects of stroke. Timely care could even prevent death, according to the American Stroke Association.

“With this multicenter trial, MindRhythm is providing a new opportunity for hospitals and EMS to more easily identify and treat one of the most debilitating types of strokes,” John Keane, president and CEO of MindRhythm, said in a statement. “We are proud to be working with some of the brightest minds in medicine to help solve one of medicine’s most critical problems.”

THE LARGER TREND

Several other companies have clinical decision support tools for strokes. Viz.ai, a care-coordination company that uses AI to detect strokes, recently scored $71 million in a Series C round. Last summer, RapidAI received FDA clearance for its Rapid ASPECTS neuroimaging analysis device that searches for early signs of brain infarction.

454,Meru Health develops digital mental health support program for employees with mild anxiety and depression ,"Looking to prevention, Meru Health, maker of digital mental health tools, is launching a new program aimed at helping employees dealing with mild depression or anxiety symptoms.

The program, called Meru Health Coaching, will use the Emotional Intelligence model and will combine video coaching with digital content.

From the patient perspective, the program will include an onboarding video call, digital content, virtual workshops and a chat-based support program from both a coach and peer group, according to the company.

A participant's one-on-one video call will be centered on their unique needs. After the call, patients can tap into the prerecorded videos and other digital content as much as they need. Participants will also have weekly group workshops.

Meru will sell the new program to employers in order to help care for employees' mental health. According to Meru Health, insurance and employee benefits provider Unum will be the first to go live with Meru Health's offering.

""With Meru Health Coaching, employers can assist employees to reduce stress, increase resilience, improve wellbeing and enhance personal development. The employees are guided to take Meru Health’s Digital Triage, which is a confidential, self-guided assessment of one’s state of wellbeing,"" Kristian Ranta, CEO and founder of Meru Health, told MobiHealthNews.

""Those who show signs of high stress, or mild depression or anxiety symptoms are recommended to participate in the Coaching program. Before, during, and after the program, the employer will get aggregated reports on the state of their population's mental wellbeing and how it’s improving.

""This is a great way for the client to enhance their mental health offerings to their employees and provide a prevention solution to help be more proactive in maintaining mental well-being.""

Ranta stressed that Meru Health is interested in the mental health prevention space.

""Mental Health-related prevention is now more important than ever. Not only do we have a record number of clinical-level mental illnesses, but also the sub-clinical population, those with high levels of stress or mild depression/anxiety, is at record heights,"" Ranta said.

""And if we don’t help this population now, we will risk these people sliding into more serious mental illness. Just like with any other health condition, we can and should take action to prevent mental illness.

""Our approach is based on the Emotional Intelligence framework to help people build self-regulation skills. This way we can help them reduce stress, enhance relationships, expand positive influence and sustain optimism and resilience through stressful circumstances.""

WHY IT MATTERS

Both depression and anxiety are common conditions in the U.S. According to the CDC, about 16 million Americans are impacted by depression every year. Additionally, 11.2% of adults report they regularly feel worried, nervous or anxious.

However, today there is a shortage of mental health providers. National Council of Behavioral Health reported that 77% of counties in the US are experiencing a shortage of mental health professionals. Increasingly innovators are looking to tackle this gap with the help of tech.

""Depression and anxiety have tripled or even quadrupled during the pandemic, according to the latest research. While we need to urgently help those with depression or anxiety, it's important to realize that there will be a lot of aftermath from these adverse events. There will be consequences for our mental wellbeing that we will be dealing with for a long time to come, and we need to prepare for that.

""When it comes to trends, we are seeing more and more the shift to value-based care, even in mental health. We are also seeing more scientific evidence required and more accountability from providers when it comes to quality of care.""

THE LARGER TREND

Last year, Meru Health landed $8.1 million in Series A, building on its $4.2 million seed funding round. The company, which is known for its 12-week mental health coaching program, also launched a biofeedback tool in 2019. The tool is clipped on a user’s ear when they are doing a specific biofeedback practice provided by the Meru Health platform.

Over the last year, we've seen an uptick in interest in digital mental health. According to Rock Health's 2020 report, digital mental health funding increased by 2.9x compared to funding in 2019. Like Meru Health, many are focusing on the employer space.

455,Exploring low carb diets during pregnancy,"The keto diet (high fat, low carbohydrate) is popular among both men and women. Keto diets are attractive because they can result in significant and fast weight loss, but there are some health concerns associated with this, the most important being the lack of good sugars in the diet. The body requires sugar from glucose and other carb sources to produce ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the main energy transporting molecule in your body.2

Although low carb diets during pregnancy are thought to be associated with lower maternal weight gain, there are some notable risks.

What are the potential risks of a low carbohydrate diet during pregnancy?

According to a study conducted in Switzerland that looked at the diet of 626 women, a low carbohydrate intake during pregnancy was associated with low birth weights. The research had a longitudinal component, and these children were assessed at a mean of 29 years of age. The study reported increased blood pressure among these individuals.1 The increase noted later in their lives is thought to be caused by the initial fetal malnutrition associated with the mothers’ carbohydrate-poor diets, as other risk factors were analyzed such as the individual’s health and dietary habits. A low carb diet during pregnancy was also associated with low weight gain for the mothers in this study, which can lead to a loss of energy as well as fetal vitamin and mineral deficiency.1

What are the findings with the risks of low carb diets in pregnancy?

It was reported that diets that included high protein and low carb intake were associated with cases of higher systolic blood pressure among the children, later in life during the follow-up study.1 Conversely, diets with high fish intake but low carbs and red meat showed increased diastolic blood pressure levels among offspring.

Adequate maternal nutrition is extremely important for the future of their children’s health, and high blood pressure can become extremely dangerous and even life threatening. According to this study, sufficient carbohydrate intake during pregnancy is important for ensuring good health of the offspring.

What about a high fat intake?

A high fat, low carb intake, also known as a keto diet, has been reported to have negative health effects in mice offspring.2 A study conducted on maternal mice undergoing a keto diet made associations between low carb intake and low birthweight of offspring, changes in heart mass, enlarged spinal cords and skeletal organs, and mis-shaped brain regions, which can potentially affect behaviour.2

The mice in this study also had decreased triglyceride (stored fat) levels, and high cholesterol, which is known to be dangerous for heart health. Blood sugar levels were also lowered in offspring, due to the lack of available sugars from the diet. The body primarily burns fat during a keto diet, instead of carbs, so fat stores and available sugars both reduce. This leads to increased nutritional demands of the fetus, resulting in smaller organs and low birth weights.2 Glucose is the preferred energy source and growth molecule for most organs, so decreasing the available supply can affect organ size and development.

Carbohydrates are an essential fuel source for body the pregnant mother and the developing baby, and with increased nutritional demands, carbs are nutrient dense and should be a macronutrient that is included in a balanced diet during pregnancy.

456,The effects of social media on mental health,"Social media can have significant effects on various mental health concerns, such as depression, anxiety, addictions, and insomnia.

Social media has become tremendously common over the past decade. A majority of people report using some type of social media platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter, at least once per day.1

According to recent data, as many as 90% of young adults currently spend time on social media sites.2 This figure has increased nearly nine-fold since 2005, where only 12.5% reported frequent time spent on social media platforms.2

With such a rise in the use of social media, many researchers have begun investigating its effects on mental health.

Disorders such as depression and anxiety have been very common in the past several decades. Amongst adults in the United States, approximately 7% of adults are affected by depression each year, while 18% are reported to be affected by anxiety.3

Among the younger population, reports of mental health problems are particularly disturbing. Some data suggest, for instance, that 30% of college students are affected by depression, while 58% of counselling centers in the United States witnessed an increase in students seeking help for depression.2

Such mental health disorders have been linked to severely diminished functioning and serious mental anguish, but several studies have shown an increased risk of developing other illnesses and even increased rates of mortality.4

Anxiety, depression, insomnia, stress and social media use

One study examined the effects of social media on mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety, insomnia, and stress.1 The study included over 450 adult participants who completed surveys related to social media use and mental health.

The study found that participants who reported problematic social media use (characterized by excessive use of social media platforms) were significantly more likely to have higher anxiety, depression, and insomnia levels.1 However, the study reported that stress levels did not increase in these participants. In fact, stress was found to mediate the relationship between depression, anxiety, insomnia, and problematic social media use.

The researchers explain that while social media sites allow for more easy and frequent interactions with other people, such interactions are not of the same quality as those found in the real world. Nevertheless, in some circumstances, social media use can increase social support and life satisfaction, as well as enhancing self-expression and identity development.1 In this way, the researchers suggest that social media may actually become a protective factor against depression.1

While problematic social media use was found not to be related to increased levels of stress, the study determined that stress fully mediated the relationship between such social media use, depression, and insomnia, while partially mediating its relation with anxiety. The researchers suggested that time spent on social media platforms could be a coping strategy used when experiencing stress.1

Patterns of social media use and mental health

Another study sought to understand particular patterns of social media use, and how these may be associated with depression and anxiety symptoms.3 The researchers administered online surveys to over 1,700 young adults in the United States. The study reported that the participants could be classified into one of five different clusters. These clusters were named Unplugged, Concentrated Dabblers, Diffuse Dabblers, Connected, and Wired.3

Those categorized as Unplugged showed no high levels of any categorized variables and included 18% of the sample. Similarly, 19% were categorized as concentrated dabblers, which reported spending large amounts of time on these sites and a strong emotional connection to a social media platform. Diffuse Dabblers represented 31% of the sample and reported using many different social media platforms without it being considered problematic use. The Connected cluster included 15% of the sample, with participants reporting a combination of using multiple platforms characterized by high intensity and frequency of such social media use. The last cluster, Wired, which contained 13% of the sample, was considered to be demonstrating problematic social media use, which can be thought of as an addiction-like relation to social media.3

Perhaps not surprisingly, the Wired cluster was found to have the highest association with moderate to severe depressive symptoms. The Connected cluster was also found to be associated with an increased risk of such symptoms, though to a lesser extent. A similar pattern of increased symptoms was found with anxiety, whereby Wired cluster participants were highest followed Connected cluster participants, with no significant relationship determined between any other cluster.3

Interestingly, the researchers determined that while participants categorized into the Connected cluster were very similar in terms of high frequency, time, and intensity, the same was not the case in the Wired cluster. The researchers determined that the observed negative effects on mental health were more dependent on a particular pattern exhibited by the Wired cluster than simply on increased volume of use.3

Particular behaviors related to social media and mental health

Another study examined the particular social media use behaviors and their association with symptoms of depression. The researchers administered an online survey to over 500 undergraduate students between the ages of 18 and 38, exploring their use of platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat.4

Upon examining the results, the researchers discovered three types of behaviors that were particularly related to major depressive disorder: social comparisons, social media addiction, and social interactions.4

Specifically, people who were more likely to compare themselves to others who are better off, who indicated being more bothered if tagged in an unflattering picture, and those less likely to post pictures of themselves with others, were more likely to meet the criteria for a major depressive disorder.4 Additionally, higher levels of social interactions, such as following over 300 people on Twitter, were related to lower levels of depression symptoms.

Participants who scored higher on a social media addiction scale were significantly more likely to show symptoms of depression.

Although these results seem to indicate a clear link between some types of social media use and depression, it is not possible to make firm conclusions. It is just as likely that many of these behaviors are an outward display of depressive symptoms. For instance, rumination is a very common symptom in people who experience depression and may explain such behaviors as being bothered when tagged in an unflattering picture. Similarly, social isolation is often very common in people suffering from depression and can explain the finding that following fewer people on Twitter is related to such symptoms. It is also possible, as the researchers point out, that social media use acts as a shield from anxiety-provoking real-life interactions. Social media use can also be an adaptive response by people experiencing emotional difficulties, with such individuals seeking to receive social support.4

Treatment of problematic social media use

Although not much has been written on this topic, several researchers have examined potential treatment strategies for problematic social media use. For instance, one strategy may be to write down the amount of time a person spends on social media, and how valuable they find the particular social media site.2 Another possible strategy is for a clinician to work with a patient on setting a specific time of day they can engage in social media use.2 Some people can even benefit from taking a ‘digital sabbatical’, or a period of time where they discontinue the use of social media or other networking sites, while still maintaining important connections with others.2

It is important, as is often the case, that if you feel that your use of social media sites is negatively impacting your life, you seek out the help of mental health professional. A healthcare worker can assist with finding the best course of treatment when someone is experiencing distress from problematic social media use. Although the majority of people do not appear to report severe mental health issues related to social media use, some may find that such sites are causing them particularly severe pain and distress.

While problematic social media use is still a newer area of research, it is becoming clearer that this issue is similar in nature to other types of addiction. Therefore, interventions by professional mental health practitioners may be necessary in some cases, and some individuals may benefit greatly from working with a therapist.

457,Do live probiotics improve gut health?,"A recent study investigated if good bacteria in a particular formulation can reach the gut unmodified to colonise and produce health benefits.

Products containing probiotic species has produced a lucrative global market with a predicted profit of over $46 billion by 2020. However, the methods by which these probiotic supplements are made for oral intake are poor and fail to prevent the breakdown of these bacteria by the human digestive tract. This means that these good bacteria do not reach the small intestine in a functioning state, and any health benefits felt are likely to be placebo.

New research conducted and published in the International Journal of Pharmaceutics found that good bacteria given using the live probiotic SymproveTM can effectively travel through the digestive tract unaffected, colonise the gut and modify the gut flora and immune response.

The bacteria was examined throughout this study using a new Simulator of the Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem (SHIME) and bacteria obtained from healthy human donors. Using this novel technique, researchers were able to examine the bacteria through in-vitro simulation of the human digestive tract, and thus bypass the need for invasive techniques.

Researchers of this study found that the introduction of the probiotics in Symprove to healthy human donors altered the percentage of bacterial groups in the gut flora, and this created a substantial increase in butyrate (a fatty acid which is important for health and wellbeing).

The study found that Symprove also increased the anti-inflammatory markers IL-6 and IL-10 and decreased the levels of inflammatory chemokines IL-8, MCP-1 and CXCL10, which are linked to inflammatory conditions and viral infections.

Several health conditions, including irritable bowel syndrome, are found to have a lack of bacteria called firmicutes and actinobacteria and Symprove was shown to increase the levels of these good bacteria. It is also very important to know the influence of probiotics vs prebiotics for particular gut health problems. So VitaLiving has a valuable article about this. Click here to take a look.

Barry Smith, Symprove Limited Founder and Chairmen commented, “Our research over the last 20 years has pushed to understand more about the microbiome and the essential role it plays in our overall health. This new research demonstrates the impact live and active probiotics can have on the body beyond the gut.”

458,Can you mix COVID-19 vaccines?,"There are many vaccines currently in development against COVID-19, and multiple currently being rolled out in countries worldwide. With the demand significantly outpacing supply, some are beginning to wonder whether mixing first and second doses may become a reality. But can you mix COVID-19 vaccines? Is there any research to support doing so?

mRNA vaccines

The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are mRNA vaccines. mRNA stands for messenger ribonucleic acid. These vaccines teach the body to mount an immune response against the spike protein found on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (3). When exposed to COVID-19, the body will recognize the virus and has the tools to fight it off.

Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines require a second dose of mRNA vaccine given weeks after the first for COVID-19 disease control and prevention. The second dose of the vaccine increases the vaccine’s effectiveness in preventing COVID-19 infection.

Viral vector vaccines

AstraZeneca’s vaccine is a result of a partnership between AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford. The University of Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine’s technology is different from that found in mRNA vaccines. It is a viral vector vaccine. The vector used in the vaccine is derived from a modified adenovirus that normally infects chimpanzees. Adenoviruses are common viruses that cause cold-like symptoms (5). Part of the COVID-19 spike protein is carried by the modified adenovirus, which triggers immune responses in humans (4).

The Johnson & Johnson / Janssen COVID-19 vaccine has the advantage of being a single-shot vaccine that does not require a second dose. However, this vaccine is currently on hold in the US due to reports of severe blood clots in a small number of people. Because of this, the CDC has recommended pausing its use until scientists have been able to perform a more detailed review of its safety and performance.

Vaccine distribution and shortages

Unfortunately, vaccines are not available equally throughout the world. Most of the approved vaccines have been distributed in the high- and middle-income countries of the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, China, and India. More than half of all purchased doses of COVID-19 vaccines going to these countries (7). This leaves other middle- and low-income countries with little access to protection against COVID-19. The current rate of vaccine distribution in low-income countries could possibly only reach 60% vaccinated by 2023 or later (7).

To address this supply issue, some countries have extended the length of time required between the two doses (8). The hope is that the initial dose of the vaccine will provide enough protection while allowing more people to receive the first dose of a vaccine.

On top of these struggles, some vaccine manufacturers warn they may soon face a shortage of raw materials (9). Novavax has experienced a shortage of plastic bags used to grow cells. Pfizer also cut production targets due to raw material quality issues (10).

Because of potential vaccine shortages and the different vaccines that might be available, the possibility of being able to mix COVID-19 vaccines could be another option.

Research for mixing COVID-19 vaccines

Researchers have already begun to study whether or not COVID-19 vaccines can be mixed and matched. A mixed vaccine study is currently being conducted using the Russian COVID-19 vaccine Sputnik V and the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine (2). Study participants were initially given a dose of the Sputnik V vaccine, a vector vaccine. Three weeks later, participants receive a booster shot of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine (2). Early efficacy results were promising.

Another clinical trial is studying the safety and efficacy of mixing vaccines. The clinical trial is a non-inferiority study, aimed at determining whether mixing vaccines is worse than non-mixing. Named the Com-Cov study, the initial arm of the study investigated the side effects of mixing and matching the AstraZeneca/Oxford and Pfizer vaccines. The study investigated various vaccine combinations and different lengths of time between doses.

Since the study was initiated, six new arms are being planned. These arms will investigate the effects of mixing the Pfizer vaccine with either the Moderna or Novavax vaccines and the AstraZeneca vaccine with Moderna or Novavax vaccines. Two other arms will compare these results to non-mixing, normal doses of Pfizer/Pfizer and AstraZeneca/AstraZeneca (11).

The investigators hope that the results will help more people to get vaccinated, allow immunization courses to be completed more quickly, and create backup plans if one vaccine runs out of stock.

Currently, the CDC discourages people from the mix and match vaccine approach (12), except in extreme circumstances. A similar stance was taken in England in the Public Health England’s Green Book guidance (8). While mixing vaccines has been a common practice in routine immunizations in the past (13), the COVID-19 vaccines have not had enough clinical study data to support this practice yet.

If the results from the current mix and match COVID-19 vaccines are positive, mixing COVID-19 vaccines may become a common practice in the future. Until enough clinical data has been obtained, people should continue with current advice and public health measures to help protect themselves from infection.

459,How does general anesthesia work?,"Anesthesia is a medical treatment in which medications, known as anesthetics, are given to patients during surgery or other medical procedures that can be considered painful. These anesthetics provide pain relief by inducing a loss of sensation in a particular part of the body or the whole body. They can also help induce a loss of consciousness and muscle relaxation, depending on the type of anesthesia.1 How does general anesthesia work?

Types of anesthesia

There are four types of anesthesia. These include sedation, local anesthesia, regional anesthesia, and general anesthesia. The choice of anesthesia depends on the type of procedure undertaken, length of the procedure, patient’s health, and preferences.

Local anesthesia

Local anesthesia involves numbing the pain in a particular part of the body upon which the medical procedure is performed.2 Patients given the drugs for local anesthesia, remain awake during the procedure. The drugs are either directly injected through the skin and tissues or applied on the skin, absorbing the medication. Local anesthesia is commonly used for dental procedures, biopsies, and minor surgeries.

Regional anesthesia

Regional anesthesia is a type of anesthesia in which pain in a specific region of the body is numbed.3 It is most commonly used in reproductive surgeries, childbirth as well as hand or foot surgeries. Like local anesthesia, patients stay awake during the surgical procedure. There are two types of regional anesthesia: epidural and spinal anesthesia.

General anesthesia

General anesthesia is a type of anesthesia in which the patient is unconscious during a surgical procedure that can take several hours to complete.4 It is commonly used for serious or major surgeries that can affect a person’s breathing or lead to significant loss of blood.5

General anesthesia involves using drugs called general anesthetics. These consist of a combination of different medications including sedatives, muscle relaxants, opioids (pain relief) and tranquilizers (lower anxiety)4,5. The anesthetics are usually administered by either IV (through the veins) or gas inhalation.

The general anesthetics work to induce unconsciousness and can lead to pain relief for the whole body, muscle relaxation and loss of movement.6 These physiological responses generally depend on the type and dosage of the medications used to produce anesthesia.7

In this article, we will provide a detailed overview of how general anesthesia works.

How does general anesthesia work?

Research indicates general anesthesia works by inhibiting transmission of nerve signals in the central nervous system. According to some studies, the anesthetics target neurotransmitters and proteins in the nerve cell membranes to induce unconsciousness, block pain as well as cause amnesia or loss of movement.7,8

A 2020 study, published in The Journal of Neuroscience, reported that a general anesthetic known as isoflurane is linked to decreased transmission of nerve signals responsible for controlling movement or cognition in rats.8 This study found that isoflurane, an anesthetic inhaled as gas, reduced the levels of neurotransmitters, suggesting that it can potentially induce the responses associated with anesthesia by inhibiting these signals. However, more research and clinical studies are needed to further understand the mechanisms of this general anesthetic.

In a 2018 study, published in Cell Reports, Propofol, a general anesthetic delivered through the veins, induces sedation or unconsciousness in patients by inhibiting the transmission of nerve signals in the brain. According to the researchers, this is done by blocking the release of the neurotransmitters and limiting movement of the Syntaxin1A protein in the nerve cell membrane.9 However, more research is needed to determine if this general anesthetic can potentially elicit other responses in the body during anesthesia.

Some studies suggest that certain responses of general anesthesia may be linked to particular regions in the brain and the central nervous system.7 The effects of sedation or unconsciousness may be linked to the neocortex and thalamus, while amnesia may be linked to the hippocampus.

Equipment for general anesthesia

An anesthesia machine is the equipment used for general anesthesia. This equipment includes a ventilator, gas supply system, breathing apparatus, vaporizers and suction equipment.5 It also has a monitor displaying the patient’s vital signs including blood pressure and heart rate.

The anesthesia machine works to prepare a mixture of gases and vapours needed for this procedure. This gas mixture, which includes oxygen are supplied from cylinders and delivered to the breathing apparatus via the vaporizer.10 The breathing apparatus can include a face mask, breathing tube, oral or nasal airway device, or a laryngoscope.5

Who is responsible for providing anesthesia?

Anesthesia care is provided by an anesthesiologist, a specially trained doctor before, during, and after surgery when the patient is then sent to the recovery room.4,6 The doctor is usually assisted by a nurse anesthetist as well as assistants specially trained to administer anesthesia.

The anesthesiologist discusses the details of the procedure with the patient during which they provide instructions on what the patient can eat or drink before their surgery.4 They also discuss with the patient about their medications and help determine what medications can be taken before surgery.

Risks and side effects of general anesthesia

Common side effects of general anesthesia include nausea and vomiting that generally occur immediately after the medical procedure.4 Other side effects may include sore throat, confusion, memory loss, chills, dizziness, and urinary retention.5 Patients may also be at risk of damage to their vocal cords, teeth, gums, and lips from the breathing tubes inserted through their mouth.4

Rare but more serious side effects include malignant hyperthermia (a muscle disease), heart attack, and stroke.4 Older patients or those with medical conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetics, heart disease, kidney problems, or lung disease are generally at increased risk of developing these side effects.

Talk to your doctor about your condition and any medications you are taking as that can potentially have an effect on the type of anesthesia you can be given.

460,5 Common Myths About Addiction Treatment,"Addictions are incredibly difficult to live with, no matter which substance or substances are at play. Many people want help with their addictions, but they often feel nervous about seeking treatment or feel as if they have failed if they can’t overcome addiction on their own. Learn five common myths about addiction treatment below, or read about addiction treatment in Lexington.

1. Going to Rehab Is the Only Option

In-patient rehab can be a helpful way for many people to start on their path toward addiction recovery, but what works for some people may not work for others. Fortunately, there are now more addiction treatment options than ever before, and many of them can be done in an outpatient format.

It may take some time to discover which treatment option(s) work best for you, but working to uncover the right treatment is a worthwhile endeavor. Your treatment team will work with you to devise a comprehensive plan.

2. Addiction Treatment is Unaffordable

Many people may continue to avoid seeking treatment or getting help because they don’t believe they will be able to afford treatment. Fortunately, many treatment clinics now accept insurance or payment plans that can make getting professional help much more accessible for the public.

3. Relapses Are Complete Failures

It can feel devastating to break a streak of weeks, months, or years of sobriety and relapse, and many people feel like a failure if they use again. Addiction recovery isn’t always a linear progression, and it’s often not as straightforward as we wish it could be.

Although we do our best to avoid relapses, they do happen sometimes, and it often just means that it’s time for a new game plan.

4. People Won’t Seek Treatment Until They Have Hit a Low Point

It’s true that people do sometimes seek treatment when they feel as though they have reached rock bottom, but this isn’t always the case. Sometimes people can feel themselves heading down a slippery path, and they seek treatment before their addictions have devastating consequences.

Hitting a low point is not a prerequisite for getting help with addictions, and everyone who is struggling with substance abuse is encouraged to get help as soon as they need it.

5. Overcoming Addiction Is All About Willpower and Strength

Many people put off getting help for their addictions because they believe that they should be able to just resist temptation and avoid the substances they abuse. Many substances that people get addicted to affect the brain in ways that facilitate strong cravings and compulsions to use. It’s simply not likely that a person can quit using a substance they are addicted to just by willing themselves out of it.

The Bottom Line

Although there are plenty of myths surrounding addiction and treatment, society seems to be headed in a more empathetic and compassionate direction when dealing with them. If you or a loved one is struggling with substance abuse, it is important to get help as soon as you can to prevent it from spiraling out of control.

461,What are the best foods for gut health?,"The average human gut contains approximately 300-500 different species of bacteria, with 500+ different species in the lower large intestine alone.1 The number of bacteria living in our intestines is roughly ten times the total number of cells in our entire body!2 These bacteria are not all good – some are bad bacteria that can seriously harm our health if found in high populations. Altering our diets can enhance the growth of beneficial bacteria in our gut, helping us combat certain diseases and abdominal discomfort. What are the best foods for gut health?

Good gut bacteria include those that produce vitamin K, which are used in the blood clotting process. The gut microbiome also helps facilitate efficient fat metabolism and plays an important role in protecting against harmful pathogens.

How do we know if we have a healthy gut?

A key indicator of a healthy gut is a regular bowel movement. However, if regular bowel movements include diarrhea or constipation, this may indicate an unhealthy gut. Experts also warn that abdominal pain, excessive gas, and bloating can indicate poor gut health.

If you experience daily abdominal discomfort or irregular bowel movements, you may benefit from a microbiome boost. Incorporating certain foods into the diet can help build a strong symbiotic microbiome.

Foods that promote a healthy gut

Dietary fibre

Fibre is a carbohydrate that humans actually cannot digest – but the bacteria in the gut can. Some gut bacteria actually use soluble fibre as an energy source, promoting bacterial growth and enhancing immunity of the digestive system.

Insoluble fibre, such as the fibre found in cereals and wheat grains, is not digested by bacteria.3 This fibre retains water in the stool and has been shown to increase the size of bowel movements, increase stool output and cause a faster rate of stool passage through the gut.

One study reported that a high intake of fibre from cereal and whole grains significantly reduced the risk for colorectal cancer.4 A similar study looked at the relationship between fibre intake and colon health. They found that age, biological sex, lifestyle, and other dietary variables did not affect the decreased colorectal cancer risk observed with increased dietary fibre intake.5 The study also found that dietary fibre from fruits, vegetables, and cereals helped reduced the risk of colon cancer, but only cereal fibre significantly reduced the risk of rectal cancer.5

Vegetables

Certain vegetables can make your gut feel better than others. Vegetables that are “inulin-rich” contain inulin-type fructans that are a fermentable dietary fibre. Such inulin-containing vegetables include asparagus, garlic, leeks, bananas, and chicory root. A study took 26 healthy individuals and put them on an inulin-rich diet for two weeks. The researchers observed an increase in the gut bacteria Bifidobacterium, which has been associated with increased flatulence, as was experienced by the study participants.6 They also observed a decrease in another type of bacteria associated with intestinal discomfort. The individuals also showed increased feeling of fullness and a reduced desire to eat salty, sweet, and fatty foods. Another study reported that prebiotics like the fructans in high-inulin vegetables were associated with increased production of gut peptides that contribute to the feeling of being full.7

Protein

Some of our gut microbes need nitrogen as an energy source. Dietary protein acts as a major source of nitrogen for these bacteria to properly function. With nitrogen, these bacteria produce short chain fatty acids, which are required by some other bacteria and colorectal tissue for energy.8

But are all protein sources beneficial to gut health?

Red meat contains a carbohydrate compound that we cannot produce ourselves. Studies have shown that when we consume red meat, our immune system recognizes this compound as foreign material. The resulting immune system response leads to inflammation, which has been shown to contribute to colorectal cancer 9 and atherosclerosis.10 One of the health benefits of our gut microbiome is that some bacteria produce enzymes that help break down this compound, preventing inflammation.11

Another study looked at whether the temperature at which red meat is cooked alters the severity of the inflammation and cell damage. In particular, they studied colorectal cell DNA damage in meat cooked at high versus low temperatures. Their findings suggest that meat cooked at higher temperatures may increase the risk of colorectal adenoma, a benign mass in the colon that can be a precursor for colon cancer.12 They observed that when cruciferous vegetables and yogurt were added to a high temperature meat diet, the mutagenicity, or risk for colorectal cancer, decreased.

Prebiotics

Prebiotics promote bacterial growth. A study took 10 healthy individuals and gave half of them 16g/day of prebiotics for two weeks. They observed that bacteria fermentation increased by an approximate factor of three.7 They also observed a significant increase in levels of gut-secreted peptides called peptide 1 and peptide YY. High levels of these peptides contribute to appetite regulation and satiety. Prebiotics can be consumed as a supplement or are found in relatively high concentrations in chicory root, wheat bran, and barley.

Probiotics

Probiotics are live strains of bacteria that add to the bacterial population in your gut. Yogurt contains lactic acid-producing bacteria called Lactobacillus acidophilus that bind to a specific type of bacteria in the gut. One study observed that in the presence of L. acidophilus, the bacteria that causes diarrhea were less able to bind to the gut lining to cause infection.13 They concluded that there is a dose-dependent relationship between this probiotic and increased gut immunity against pathogens.

What if you have a health condition or a strict diet. How should your diet change to promote optimal gut health?

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)

IBS is characterized by gastrointestinal discomfort including excessive bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea, flatulence, and constipation. Health professionals do not know exactly what causes IBS, but the newly developed low-FODMAP diet has shown promise in alleviating IBS symptoms.

The low FODMAP diet

FODMAPS are fermentable carbohydrates. Although fermented foods can be good for promoting bacterial growth, they can contribute to the symptoms of IBS. Medical researchers have been following the success of the low-FODMAP in individuals with IBS, and it has been reported that up to 86% of patients with IBS had overall improved gastrointestinal comfort and functioning while on the diet.14

However, studies have also shown that a low FODMAP diet risks nutritional deprivation and can harm gut bacteria.15 Healthcare professionals suggest that decreasing FODMAP foods may help alleviate IBS symptoms, but FODMAPS should not be eliminated completely. This risk of insufficient nutrition has led researchers to investigate the gluten-free diet as an alternative IBS treatment.

Gluten-free diet

Some individuals with IBS have been recorded as tying a gluten-free diet, because gluten has been linked to similar bowel symptoms. One study took 41 patients with IBS and put them on a gluten-free diet for six weeks. After the six weeks, 71% of patients experienced a significant reduction in IBS symptoms.16

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)

IBD includes ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. Both can seriously damage health by limiting nutritional intake and causing severe weight loss.

One study found that those with infectious colitis and irritable bowel disease had lower levels of a type of bacteria that normally helps protect gut mucus and normal bowel function.17 According to the Crohn’s and Colitis Foundation, the best foods for gut health for those with IBD includes low-fibre fruits such as cantaloupe and melon, lean protein, and non-cruciferous vegetables.18

Lactose intolerance

If you are lactose intolerant, you lack the ability to fully digest a type of sugar, lactose, commonly found in dairy products. Dairy is not one of the best foods for gut health in lactose intolerant individuals because it can lead to severe bloating, diarrhea, and abdominal discomfort. As such, these foods should be avoided.

Vegan & vegetarian diets

Research has shown that a diet high in plant-based foods tends to induce a more diverse and stable gut microbiome. Plant-based foods tend to have a high fibre content, contributing to the production of short chain fatty acids which play a part in intestine function. Individuals who consume a high plant-based diet also tend to eat more polyphenols, which help strengthen the immune system against pathogens and inflammation.19

Vegans and vegetarian have significantly higher counts of Bacteroidetes than omnivores, which has been found low in IBD patients.20 This research suggests than the higher vegetable consumption seen in vegans and vegetarians strengthens gut health. Experts advise that a strict vegan/vegetarian diet is not necessary to achieve these benefits, as long as the omnivore diet is high in plant products.

The best foods for gut health will vary depending on personal health and diet restrictions. Studies have suggested that for the healthy individual, consuming dietary fibre, lean protein, prebiotics and probiotics can assist in maintaining gut health.

Rich foods such as fried foods, are more difficult to digest and may disrupt gut health. Individuals with health conditions such as IBS or IBD may need to search for low fibre and low FODMAP foods to ease symptoms.

Each person’s optimal gut-friendly diet will differ depending on dietary restrictions and other bowel-related diseases, and as such, online dietary suggestions should be used for informational purposes only. Speak with your healthcare provider to better understand how to optimize your gut health.

462,Natural remedies for mosquito bites,"Mosquitos are attracted to blood, and they bite to get their “food”.1 Mosquito bites are rarely felt, and often they aren’t noticed until hours later.

Mosquito bites are generally harmless, but sometimes they pose serious health concerns. Mosquitos can carry diseases, so they can end up passing on illnesses when they bite.1

Symptoms of mosquito bites

When a mosquito feeds, it injects saliva into the skin. The body reacts to the unwanted foreign substance through mild or severe reactions.1

Mosquito bites usually cause a red bump on the skin that can get itchy, swollen, and very uncomfortable.Puffiness, blisters, and dark bruise-like spots are also commonly seen.1

Another concern with mosquito bites is having an allergic reaction to the bite itself.1 Symptoms of an allergic reaction can range from a low-grade fever to hives and swollen lymph nodes.1

So, what are some natural remedies to treat mosquito bites?

Natural remedies for mosquito bites

Tea tree oil

Mosquito bites, like many other bug bites, can cause rashes, swelling around the area, and pain. The itchy nature of mosquito bites makes it so that over-scratching can cause infections.1

Tea tree oil (formally known as Melaleuca alternifolia) is a plant native to Australia.2 It is an essential oil that is oftentimes used to help treat uncomfortable symptoms caused by bug bites.

Tea tree oil is made up of chemicals that can fight bacteria, swelling, and pain.2 Its most useful characteristic is that it can calm itchy skin. A recent study found that soothing skin ointments, made of at least 5% tea tree oil, could greatly decrease the amount of discomfort in people with itchy eyes.3

Aloe vera

Aloe vera is an incredibly useful and versatile plant. Beyond its uses as a nutritious food, post-sunburn gel, and household decoration, aloe vera can also help to treat mosquito bites.

When a mosquito bites, it causes a reaction from the body’s defense system, known as the immune system. The immune system fights against the unwanted bug bites through a series of reactions that cause inflammation in and around the area. The inflammation is what causes the itchy redness and swelling.

Aloe vera is known to fight against inflammation.4 Its anti-inflammatory properties are how it helps decrease the redness and swelling of mosquito bites, as well as soothe the itching.4

Baking soda

Baking soda (also known as sodium bicarbonate) is a staple ingredient in most kitchens. Interestingly, it can also be used to treat mosquito, and other, insect bites. Baking soda is able to ease the itching, redness, and stinging that come with bug bites.1

In fact, many over-the-counter treatment creams contain baking soda as an ingredient. A baking soda paste can be made as a natural home remedy by mixing three parts of water with one part baking soda.1

Ice pack

Ice packs are commonly used to alleviate aches, pains, and swelling in the body. Cold temperatures can lessen inflammation, which is why ice packs are a good way of treating swollen and inflamed bug bites.1

Applying a cold compress to the affected area is another natural remedy for mosquito bites that can reduce itchiness and provide relief.1

Over-the-counter medications

Hydrocortisone cream

Corticosteroids are a class of medications used to treat a variety of illnesses. Hydrocortisone is a popular corticosteroid used to decrease inflammation in the body.5 By decreasing inflammation, the cream reduces swelling and itchy redness caused by the immune response to mosquito bites.5

Hydrocortisone can be found over the counter as an ointment or a cream. It can be found at varying strength levels, which is useful for treating different severities of bug bites. A small amount of hydrocortisone can be applied to the skin to ease an itchy mosquito bite.5

Hydrocortisone creams may not be advisable for everyone. Pregnant women, children, and those with skin conditions should consult a doctor before using.5

Antihistamines

Histamine is a molecule that is part of the immune system, and it is released when the body senses something harmful.6 Too much histamine can lead to allergies. Mosquito bites cause allergic reactions, because the body is producing an abundant amount of histamine.6

Antihistamine medications can help relieve symptoms of mosquito bites. They work to block the effects of histamine, which overall reduces inflammation and the unpleasant symptoms of redness, swelling, rashes, and others that can happen.6

Antihistamine can be prescribed by a doctor if needed, but they are also available as over-the-counter medications. Speak with your doctor to make sure this medication is right for you.
