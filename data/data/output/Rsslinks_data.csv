32,Pediatric Obstructive Sleep Apnea,"Overview

Pediatric obstructive sleep apnea is a sleep disorder in which your child's breathing is partially or completely blocked repeatedly during sleep. The condition is due to narrowing or blockage of the upper airway during sleep.

There are differences between pediatric obstructive sleep apnea and adult sleep apnea. While adults usually have daytime sleepiness, children are more likely to have behavioral problems. The underlying cause in adults is often obesity, while in children the most common underlying condition is enlargement of the adenoids and tonsils.

Early diagnosis and treatment are important to prevent complications that can affect children's growth, cognitive development and behavior.

Symptoms

During sleep, signs and symptoms of pediatric sleep apnea might include:

Snoring

Pauses in breathing

Restless sleep

Snorting, coughing or choking

Mouth breathing

Nighttime sweating

Bed-wetting

Sleep terrors

Infants and young children with obstructive sleep apnea don't always snore. They might just have disturbed sleep.

During the day, children with sleep apnea might:

Perform poorly in school

Have difficulty paying attention

Have learning problems

Have behavioral problems

Have poor weight gain

Be hyperactive

When to see a doctor

Make an appointment with your child's doctor if your child consistently wakes up in the morning feeling tired and has behavioral problems.

Causes

Obesity is a common factor underlying obstructive sleep apnea in adults. But in children the most common condition leading to obstructive sleep apnea is enlarged tonsils and adenoids. However, obesity also plays a role in children. Other underlying factors can be craniofacial anomalies and neuromuscular disorders.

Risk factors

Besides obesity, other risk factors for pediatric sleep apnea include having:

Down syndrome

Abnormalities in the skull or face

Cerebral palsy

Sickle cell disease

Neuromuscular disease

History of low birth weight

Family history of obstructive sleep apnea

Complications

Pediatric obstructive sleep apnea can have serious complications, including:",www.mayoclinic.org
33,Healthy Food Choices for Your Family,"Page Content

​How can you ensure that your child is well nourished?

Here are some tips to keep in mind when planning and preparing meals for your family.

Variety

Your child should consume a variety of foods from the five major food groups. Each food group supplies important nutrients, including vitamins and minerals.



The five food groups and typical minimum servings:

Vegetables: 3-5 servings per day. A serving may consist of 1 cup of raw leafy vegetables, 3/4 cup of vegetable juice, or 1/2 cup of other vegetables, chopped raw or cooked.

Fruits: 2-4 servings per day. A serving may consist of 1/2 cup of sliced fruit, 3/4 cup of fruit juice, or a medium-size whole fruit, like an apple, banana, or pear.

Bread, cereal, or pasta: 6-11 servings per day. Each serving should equal 1 slice of bread, 1/2 cup of rice or pasta, or 1 ounce of cereal.

Protein foods: 2-3 servings of 2-3 ounces of cooked lean meat, poultry, or fish per day. A serving in this group may also consist of 1/2 cup of cooked dry beans, one egg, or 2 tablespoons of peanut butter for each ounce of lean meat.

Dairy products: 2-3 servings per day of 1 cup of low-fat milk or yogurt, or 1 1/2 ounces of natural cheese.

Fiber​

Fiber is a carbohydrate component of plant foods that is usually un-digestible. It is found in foods like fruits, vegetables, whole-grain breads, cereals, brown rice, beans, seeds, and nuts.

In adults: Increased fiber has been linked with a reduction of chronic gastrointestinal problems, including colon cancer, irritable bowel syndrome, and diverticulitis.

In children: Fiber's only proven benefit is its ability to ease constipation—providing bulk that can promote regular bowel movements, soften the stools, and decrease the time it takes food to travel through the intestines. But since food preferences and eating habits often get searly in life, and since high-fiber foods contain other nutrients, parents should include these foods in children's daily diets. See Kids Need Fiber: Here's Why and How.

Protein

Your child needs protein so their body can grow and function properly. This includes building new tissues and producing antibodies that help fight infections. Without essential amino acids (the building blocks of protein), children would be much more susceptible to serious diseases.

Protein-rich plants—such as dried beans and peas (legumes), grains, seeds, and nuts—can be used as valuable sources of protein. Other protein-rich foods include meat, fish, milk, yogurt, cheese, and eggs. These animal products contain high-quality protein and a full array of amino acids.

Keep in mind, however, that while red meat and shellfish are rich in protein and an important source of iron, they can also be high in fat and cholesterol as well. So, your child should consume them only in moderate amounts. Select lean cuts of meat and trim the fat before cooking. Likewise, remove skin from poultry before serving.

Fat

Humans cannot live without fats. They are a concentrated source of energy, providing essential fatty acids that are needed for a variety of bodily processes (metabolism, blood clotting, and vitamin absorption).

However, high fat intake—particularly a diet high in saturated fats—can cause problems. Saturated fats are usually solid at room temperatures and are found in fatty meats (such as beef, pork, ham, veal, and lamb) and many dairy products (whole milk, cheese, and ice cream). They can contribute to the buildup of plague in blood vessels and lead to heart disease later in life. A diet rich in saturated fats also can increase blood cholesterol, particularly in people who have inherited a tendency toward high cholesterol levels.

After age two: Children should be served foods that are lower in fat and saturated fats. Chances are that your child's favorite foods are higher in fat than is desirable. Healthy ating means relying more on low-fat, low-cholesterol foods like poultry, fish, and lean meat (broiled, baked, or roasted; not fried), soft margarine (instead of butter), low-fat dairy products, and low-saturated-fat oils from vegetables, while limiting egg consumption.

As a general guideline, fats should make up less than 30% of the calories in your child's diet. No more than about 1/3 or less of those fat calories should come from from saturated fat, with the rest coming from unsaturated (that is, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated) fats. These healthier fats are liquid at room temperature and include vegetable oils like corn, safflower, sunflower, soybean, and olive.

Some parents find the information about various types of fat confusing. In general, oils and fats that come from animals are saturated. The simplest place to start is just to reduce the amount of fatty foods of all types in your family's diet. See How to Reduce Fat and Cholesterol in Your Child's Diet.

Sugar

Limit the amount of sugar in your child's diet to to moderate levels. Sugar has plenty of calories, but dietitians often call them “empty calories"" because they have very little additional nutritional value. Even so, many children consume sugar in large amounts, usually at the expense of healthier foods. When children drink sodas, for example, they are usually leaving the milk in the refrigerator; when they eat a brownie, they may be overlooking the bowl of fruit, a good source of complex carbohydrates, on the kitchen table.

Salt

Table salt, or sodium chloride, may improve the taste of certain foods. However, researchers have found a relationship between salt in the diet and high blood pressure in some people.

High blood pres­sure afflicts about 25% of adult Americans ​​and contributes to heart attacks and strokes.

The habit of using extra salt is an learned one. So, as much as possible, serve your child foods low in salt. In the kitchen, minimize the amount of salt you add to food as you prepare it. Try using herbs, spices, or lemon juice instead. Take the salt shaker off the dinner table, or at least limit its use by your family.

Because salt acts a preservative, processed foods often contain large amounts of it. Salt-rich foods may include processed cheese, instant puddings, canned vegetables, canned soups, hot dogs, cottage cheese, salad dressings, pickles, and potato chips and other snacks.

34,Keep it Going! How to Stick with a Fitness Routine,"Sticking to a fitness routine isn't always easy with family, work, hobbies, and everything in between. These tips can help you get started and keep you moving, even when life gets busy.

Find an activity you like. Whether it's walking, biking, or playing a recreational sport, the key to maintaining your exercise routine is doing something you find interesting and enjoyable.

A workout buddy can help keep you accountable and make exercise more fun.

Schedule a time for it. You are more likely to stick with an exercise routine if it is part of your day. Find a time that's most convenient for you, whether it's first thing in the morning or after work. If you don't have 30 full minutes to dedicate to exercise, try to be active a few times throughout the day.

Get active with friends. A workout buddy can help keep you accountable and make exercise more fun. During social distancing you can do this by working out with someone in your household or with a friend or family member digitally.

Measure your progress. Keep track of how far you walked, how much weight you lifted, or how far you stretched. Measuring your progress and noting improvements will help you stay motivated.

Try something new! Exercise shouldn't be boring. Trying a new exercise video or sport is one way to keep your exercise routine fresh.",magazine.medlineplus.gov
35,How to Cope with the Stress of Social Isolation,"Social isolation, or being physically separated from others, can lead to loneliness and increased stress, especially during a pandemic.

Loneliness has been associated with higher rates of depression, anxiety, and suicide. It can also weaken our immune systems, which helps protect us from getting sick. Luckily, understanding stress and loneliness and how to manage them can help.

How stress affects us

While some stress is normal, too much of it can interfere with daily activities, relationships, and work. Symptoms of stress and anxiety include:

Feeling irritable, restless, and on edge

Feeling overwhelmed and unmotivated

Muscle tension

Fatigue or tiredness

Difficulty concentrating

Combating stress

To combat stress, make sure to eat a diet full of heart-healthy fruits, vegetables, and grains. Get enough sleep (for adults, that is usually between 7 and 8 hours) and seek out physical activity.

Connecting with nature can lower levels of stress and reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression. A walk or bike ride may make you feel better and stay physically fit. Just 30 minutes of physical activity a day can make a big difference. Remember to wear a mask even when you are outside. Also, keep 6 feet of space between yourself and people who do not live in your home.

Combating loneliness

Avoiding in-person social gatherings will help keep you and others safe. But you can stay in touch with people in other ways:

Connect with loved ones through online games, video calls, or messaging apps.

Look online for virtual exercise classes, religious services, and cultural events.

Try at-home, guided yoga, mindfulness, or meditation through a mobile app.

Consider adopting a pet. Pets can provide comfort and lower blood pressure, according to the National Institute on Aging.

Reach out to a health care professional

Stress and social isolation can worsen existing mental illness. Consult your health care provider if your feelings are getting in the way of your daily life.

""For those with mental illnesses, be sure to continue your treatment regimens,"" says Joshua Gordon, M.D., Ph.D., director of the National Institute of Mental Health. ""Consider developing a plan for telehealth sessions with your provider if you (or your provider) are quarantined or must avoid exposures to the public for any reason. And reach out to friends and family for support, virtually if necessary.""",magazine.medlineplus.gov
36,New Research on Palliative Care and COVID-19,"Jean Kutner, M.D., a professor of medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, is a well-known expert in palliative and hospice care. She is also a top researcher in the field. She says palliative care ""focuses on the whole person, addressing their spiritual, psychological, and medical needs along the whole course of their journey with a serious illness.""

This year, the COVID-19 pandemic has spotlighted the need for doctors and nurses trained in palliative care. Hospitals are treating thousands of seriously ill patients. Many of them may end up on life support with their families unable to be with them.

Dr. Kutner discussed how palliative care teams are helping patients and families during this time.

Doctors and nurses trained in palliative care have been in high demand during the pandemic. Has the crisis shown people how this kind of care can help patients and their families?

Yes, absolutely. At hospitals across the country, there has been increased demand for palliative care teams. They help overwhelmed families, patients, and hospital staff cope with this very serious illness. It has been especially hard for patients and families who have to be separated because the virus is so contagious. A palliative care team can support families that have to make difficult decisions. The pandemic has also shown the importance of having conversations about the goals of care—such as, do you want to be on a ventilator?—and documenting someone who can make medical decisions for a patient who is seriously ill or dying. This is also known as a health care proxy.

""A palliative care team can support families that have to make difficult decisions."" – Jean Kutner, M.D.

Much of the early research on the benefits of palliative care involved cancer patients. How is the scope of palliative care expanding?

It's true that palliative care had its roots in helping people with cancer. In the last five-plus years, there has been more work with people who have Parkinson's, ALS, heart failure, lung diseases like COPD, advanced kidney disease, and dementia. These groups have different needs than cancer patients. There's also been exciting research supporting children and adolescents with progressive, life-limiting illness.

Can you tell us about the NIH-funded research you are involved in?

I am the lead researcher in a large national project funded by the National Institute of Nursing Research on providing training for other palliative care researchers. I'm also doing research on training palliative care providers to help families with the most difficult conversations regarding a family member's health.

Until recently, people may not have heard of palliative care or confused it with hospice care. Is that changing?

When I gave talks to public groups about palliative care 10 years ago, I often would get blank stares. But that is changing. More people have heard of it. There is also a growing number of patient and provider groups who are huge advocates of it. I especially see that among our nursing and medical school students, even clinical psychology students. When I do interviews for residency programs in internal medicine, the students ask about rotations in palliative care. They feel it's important. This generation of trainees is truly going to change this field.",magazine.medlineplus.gov
37,Comfort Care for Kids and Their Families: A Mother's Story,"When Jake Swoyer was born in 1995, he seemed like any other healthy baby boy. His family—parents, John and Barbara Swoyer, and big brother Ryan, then 3— were thrilled.

But when Jake, who is from Sudbury, Massachusetts, was 7 months old, he had his first seizure. After that, ""he got very sick, very quickly,"" his mother says. His seizures came frequently and could last up to an hour. ""We had 23 ambulance rides in that first year.""

""I had no idea what palliative care really was or what it could do for us."" – Barbara Swoyer

Despite a lot of testing, doctors were unable to determine a cause for his seizures until Jake was nearly 10 years old, when a test revealed he had a genetic mutation associated with Dravet syndrome. Dravet syndrome is a lifelong, rare form of epilepsy that begins in the first year of life and typically doesn't respond to medication. Jake was also later diagnosed with mitochondrial dysfunction, adding to the severity and complexity of his disease.

Since he was diagnosed, Jake has suffered a long, slow, steady decline in his health, his mother says. Palliative care has made all the difference in how the family has coped with Jake's devastating condition and in helping Jake enjoy a good quality of life. He received pediatric palliative care support and services until he turned 21.

Finding palliative care

""When Jake was first diagnosed, our physician suggested enrolling him in palliative care. Like many families, my first thought was, 'Oh no, he thinks my son is dying.' I had no idea what palliative care really was or what it could do for us,"" Barbara recalls.

She finally took his suggestion after about a year. As Barbara worked with several different providers, ""a light bulb finally went off. I realized what palliative care was supposed to be,"" she says. ""Along with providing clinical and emotional support, the palliative team introduced comfort care measures. Jake was able to receive pet therapy for enjoyment, massage therapy for relaxation, and music therapy for active engagement and socialization. Each of these therapies brought joy and positive change into his daily life.""

Palliative care services also included a medical team to help with medical support and crisis management, Barbara says. ""They could come to the house, diagnose a problem, and prescribe and provide treatment. We didn't have to go to the hospital for every problem."" Having home-based medical support allowed the family to treat problems in their own home, which became especially important as Jake got older.

Embracing a difficult but important path

A chaplain and a social worker paid regular visits to the Swoyer home.

""In 25 years of caring for a child with limited life expectancy, these were two of the more meaningful and pivotal people I had the opportunity to work with,"" Barbara says. They were open to and encouraged philosophical discussion about Jake's eventual end of life.

""They helped us consider and define our goals of care,"" Barbara says. ""From these conversations, we felt at peace with past decisions and better equipped to make future decisions on Jake's behalf. It was a relief to have these discussions in periods of calm, rather than in moments of crisis.""

Barbara is a founding member of the Parent Advisory Board for Courageous Parents Network, a nonprofit organization that helps families and providers caring for children with serious illness. Her wish is for families to understand that palliative care is about helping a child live well in the face of life-threatening disease.

""It's about bringing happiness and comfort to a child, while also supporting the entire family unit, no matter where they are on their journey with serious illness,"" she says.

38,Why Does Your Back Hurt?,"Gwendolyn Sowa, M.D., Ph.D.

Identifying the cause of low back pain has become a frequent challenge for medical professionals. It is also what has encouraged Gwendolyn Sowa, M.D., Ph.D., of the University of Pittsburgh to study the topic.

Low back pain is a widespread issue in the U.S. It affects more than 25% of workers, according to a recent national health survey. An injury, working in a physically demanding job, or working in a job where you sit too much can all contribute to back pain.

""It's one of the most common causes of disability both from a quality of life perspective but also from a productivity perspective,"" Dr. Sowa says. ""It has a huge impact on how patients can function in their everyday life, whether that's their work, their home-related activities, or their leisure activities.""

Because of how widespread it is, low back pain also presents an opportunity for researchers.

""The findings on traditional imaging such as X-rays and MRIs often have a very poor correlation with patient symptoms."" – Gwendolyn Sowa, M.D., Ph.D.

An opportunity for change

""It's also one of the areas that we have the biggest opportunity to change the way we care for patients,"" Dr. Sowa explained. One of those opportunities is around identifying contributors to back pain.

""The findings on traditional imaging such as X-rays and MRIs often have a very poor correlation with patient symptoms,"" Dr. Sowa explains. She says that many people who might have physical damage to their low back may not experience any symptoms. On the other hand, some individuals might experience a great deal of low back pain but could have little visible damage.

Through her work supported by the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, Dr. Sowa and her collaborators study better ways to treat people based on their individual symptoms and medical history. This includes looking at factors like genetics, stress, lifestyle, behaviors, and activity levels.

Holistic health for low back pain

Rather than treating one symptom or only looking at one aspect of a person's pain, Dr. Sowa says she and her team aim for a more well-rounded approach.

""We want to develop precision medicine approaches to their treatment that we hope will be more effective and prevent a trial-and-error type of approach to treating these patients,"" Dr. Sowa says.

She adds that the ultimate goal of her research is to decrease unnecessary treatments and increase the chances of finding the right treatment the first time.

""If we don't improve [patients'] function and get their pain under control, they're more likely to progress to chronic back pain,"" she says.

Addressing chronic pain

Dr. Sowa also studies how to better address chronic back pain through the Back Pain Consortium (BACPAC) Research Program of the Helping to End Addiction Long-termSM Initiative, or NIH HEAL InitiativeSM. The NIH HEAL Initiative's goal is to help advance research that will address the national opioid public health crisis. Opioids are often prescribed for low back pain. They are strong and sometimes addictive painkillers that have been overused and sometimes misused, and not currently indicated for use in chronic low back pain.

To tackle this complex and common problem, teamwork is key, she notes.

""It's a complex problem, and one that an individual field is not going to solve,"" Dr. Sowa says. ""As we bring physicians and scientists from all different backgrounds together, I'm hoping we can move the needle on it.""",magazine.medlineplus.gov
39,4 Physical Activity Tips for Older Adults,"Regular physical activity is great for your mental and physical health. It also helps you stay independent as you age.

Every day presents opportunities to move more.

The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommend that you aim to exercise at least 150 minutes every week at a moderate pace, or 75 at a more vigorous pace. The guidelines also recommend that older adults do muscle-strengthening activities at least 2 days a week.

Now sure how to get started? These tips can help.

1. Talk with your doctor. Almost anyone, at any age, can exercise safely. If you're concerned about starting an exercise routine, talk with your doctor. Ask whether there are activities you should avoid and whether any health conditions you have might affect what exercises you can do safely.

2. Start gradually. Begin with low-intensity exercises like walking. Be sure to drink plenty of water before, during, and after your workout.

3. Develop a well-rounded routine. Include the four main types of exercise:

Endurance exercises increase your breathing and heart rate. Brisk walking is a good option.

Strength exercises, like lifting weights or using a resistance band, make your muscles stronger.

Balance exercises can help prevent falls. This includes standing on one foot.

Flexibility exercises, like yoga, stretch your muscles and help you stay limber and maintain mobility as you age.

4. Move throughout the day. Every day presents opportunities to move more. For example, use the stairs instead of taking the elevator. Or park far away from the grocery store entrance instead of in the closest spot.",magazine.medlineplus.gov

42,Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR TB),"Fact Sheet

(PDFpdf icon – 37k)

Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR TB)

What is tuberculosis (TB)?

Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease caused by bacteria that are spread from person to person through the air. TB usually affects the lungs, but it can also affect other parts of the body, such as the brain, the kidneys, or the spine. In most cases, TB is treatable and curable; however, persons with TB can die if they do not get proper treatment.

What is multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB)?

Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR TB) is caused by an organism that is resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampin, the two most potent TB drugs. These drugs are used to treat all persons with TB disease.

What is extensively drug resistant tuberculosis (XDR TB)?

Extensively drug resistant TB (XDR TB) is a rare type of MDR TB that is resistant to isoniazid and rifampin, plus any fluoroquinolone and at least one of three injectable second-line drugs (i.e., amikacin, kanamycin, or capreomycin).

Because XDR TB is resistant to the most potent TB drugs, patients are left with treatment options that are much less effective.

XDR TB is of special concern for persons with HIV infection or other conditions that can weaken the immune system. These persons are more likely to develop TB disease once they are infected, and also have a higher risk of death once they develop TB.

How is TB spread?

Drug-susceptible TB and drug-resistant TB are spread the same way. TB bacteria are put into the air when a person with TB disease of the lungs or throat coughs, sneezes, speaks, or sings. These bacteria can float in the air for several hours, depending on the environment. Persons who breathe in the air containing these TB bacteria can become infected.

TB is not spread by

Shaking someone’s hand

Sharing food or drink

Touching bed linens or toilet seats

Sharing toothbrushes

Kissing

How does drug resistance happen?

Resistance to anti-TB drugs can occur when these drugs are misused or mismanaged. Examples include when patients do not complete their full course of treatment; when health-care providers prescribe the wrong treatment, the wrong dose, or length of time for taking the drugs; when the supply of drugs is not always available; or when the drugs are of poor quality.

Who is at risk for getting MDR TB?

Drug resistance is more common in people who:

Do not take their TB medicine regularly

Do not take all of their TB medicine as told by their doctor or nurse

Develop TB disease again, after having taken TB medicine in the past

Come from areas of the world where drug-resistant TB is common

Have spent time with someone known to have drug-resistant TB disease

How can MDR TB be prevented?

The most important thing a person can do to prevent the spread of MDR TB is to take all of their medications exactly as prescribed by their health care provider. No doses should be missed and treatment should not be stopped early. Patients should tell their health care provider if they are having trouble taking the medications. If patients plan to travel, they should talk to their health care providers and make sure they have enough medicine to last while away.

Health care providers can help prevent MDR TB by quickly diagnosing cases, following recommended treatment guidelines, monitoring patients’ response to treatment, and making sure therapy is completed.

Another way to prevent getting MDR TB is to avoid exposure to known MDR TB patients in closed or crowded places such as hospitals, prisons, or homeless shelters. If you work in hospitals or health-care settings where TB patients are likely to be seen, you should consult infection control or occupational health experts. Ask about administrative and environmental procedures for preventing exposure to TB. Once those procedures are implemented, additional measures could include using personal respiratory protective devices.

Is there a vaccine to prevent TB?

Yes, there is a vaccine for TB disease called Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG). It is used in some countries to prevent severe forms of TB in children. However, BCG is not generally recommended in the United States because it has limited effectiveness for preventing TB overall.

What should I do if I think I have been exposed to someone with TB disease?

If you think you have been exposed to someone with TB disease, you should contact your doctor or local health department about getting a TB skin test or TB blood test. And tell the doctor or nurse when you spent time with this person.

What are the symptoms of TB disease?

The general symptoms of TB disease include feelings of sickness or weakness, weight loss, fever, and night sweats. The symptoms of TB disease of the lungs may also include coughing, chest pain, and coughing up blood. Symptoms of TB disease in other parts of the body depend on the area affected. If you have these symptoms, you should contact your doctor or local health department.

43,Good Sleep for Good Health: Get the Rest You Need,"Good Sleep for Good Health

Get the Rest You Need

Sometimes, the pace of modern life barely gives you time to stop and rest. It can make getting a good night’s sleep on a regular basis seem like a dream.

But sleep is as important for good health as diet and exercise. Good sleep improves your brain performance, mood, and health.

Not getting enough quality sleep regularly raises the risk of many diseases and disorders. These range from heart disease and stroke to obesity and dementia.

There’s more to good sleep than just the hours spent in bed, says Dr. Marishka Brown, a sleep expert at NIH. “Healthy sleep encompasses three major things,” she explains. “One is how much sleep you get. Another is sleep quality—that you get uninterrupted and refreshing sleep. The last is a consistent sleep schedule.”

People who work the night shift or irregular schedules may find getting quality sleep extra challenging. And times of great stress—like the current pandemic—can disrupt our normal sleep routines. But there are many things you can do to improve your sleep.

Sleep for Repair

Why do we need to sleep? People often think that sleep is just “down time,” when a tired brain gets to rest, says Dr. Maiken Nedergaard, who studies sleep at the University of Rochester.

“But that’s wrong,” she says. While you sleep, your brain is working. For example, sleep helps prepare your brain to learn, remember, and create.

Nedergaard and her colleagues discovered that the brain has a drainage system that removes toxins during sleep.

“When we sleep, the brain totally changes function,” she explains. “It becomes almost like a kidney, removing waste from the system.”

Her team found in mice that the drainage system removes some of the proteins linked with Alzheimer’s disease. These toxins were removed twice as fast from the brain during sleep.

Everything from blood vessels to the immune systemThe system that protects your body from invading viruses, bacteria, and other microscopic threats. uses sleep as a time for repair, says Dr. Kenneth Wright, Jr., a sleep researcher at the University of Colorado.

“There are certain repair processes that occur in the body mostly, or most effectively, during sleep,” he explains. “If you don’t get enough sleep, those processes are going to be disturbed.”

Sleep Myths and Truths

How much sleep you need changes with age. Experts recommend school-age children get at least nine hours a night and teens get between eight and 10. Most adults need at least seven hours or more of sleep each night.

There are many misunderstandings about sleep. One is that adults need less sleep as they get older. This isn’t true. Older adults still need the same amount. But sleep quality can get worse as you age. Older adults are also more likely to take medications that interfere with sleep.

Another sleep myth is that you can “catch up” on your days off. Researchers are finding that this largely isn’t the case.

“If you have one bad night’s sleep and take a nap, or sleep longer the next night, that can benefit you,” says Wright. “But if you have a week’s worth of getting too little sleep, the weekend isn’t sufficient for you to catch up. That’s not a healthy behavior.”

In a recent study, Wright and his team looked at people with consistently deficient sleep. They compared them to sleep-deprived people who got to sleep in on the weekend.

Both groups of people gained weight with lack of sleep. Their bodies’ ability to control blood sugar levels also got worse. The weekend catch-up sleep didn’t help.

On the flip side, more sleep isn’t always better, says Brown. For adults, “if you’re sleeping more than nine hours a night and you still don’t feel refreshed, there may be some underlying medical issue,” she explains.

Sleep Disorders

Some people have conditions that prevent them from getting enough quality sleep, no matter how hard they try. These problems are called sleep disorders.

The most common sleep disorder is insomnia. “Insomnia is when you have repeated difficulty getting to sleep and/or staying asleep,” says Brown. This happens despite having the time to sleep and a proper sleep environment. It can make you feel tired or unrested during the day.

Insomnia can be short-term, where people struggle to sleep for a few weeks or months. “Quite a few more people have been experiencing this during the pandemic,” Brown says. Long-term insomnia lasts for three months or longer.

Sleep apnea is another common sleep disorder. In sleep apnea, the upper airway becomes blocked during sleep. This reduces or stops airflow, which wakes people up during the night. The condition can be dangerous. If untreated, it may lead to other health problems.

If you regularly have problems sleeping, talk with your health care provider. They may have you keep a sleep diary to track your sleep for several weeks. They can also run tests, including sleep studies. These look for sleep disorders.

Getting Better Sleep

If you’re having trouble sleeping, hearing how important it is may be frustrating. But simple things can improve your odds of a good night’s sleep. See the Wise Choices box for tips to sleep better every day.

Treatments are available for many common sleep disorders. Cognitive behavioral therapy can help many people with insomnia get better sleep. Medications can also help some people.

Many people with sleep apnea benefit from using a device called a CPAP machine. These machines keep the airway open so that you can breathe. Other treatments can include special mouthguards and lifestyle changes.

For everyone, “as best you can, try to make sleep a priority,” Brown says. “Sleep is not a throwaway thing—it’s a biological necessity.”",newsinhealth.nih.gov
44,Pregnancy Check-Ups: Healthy Start for Mom and Baby,"Pregnancy Check-Ups

Healthy Start for Mom and Baby

Life is busy before a baby arrives. There are many things to do to prepare. One of the most important is to visit your health care provider regularly.

Check-ups before your baby is born are called prenatal visits. They help make sure you and your baby are healthy. Your health care provider will look for certain problems that can happen during pregnancy. Some issues are best treated early. Others can be prevented before they start.

“Prenatal care is fundamental for shaping the lives of women and their children,” says Dr. Monica Longo, an NIH expert on prenatal health. Longo cares for women with high-risk pregnancies. Such women have a higher chance of complications.

If you think you may be pregnant, schedule a visit with your provider. If you’re pregnant, you’ll need to start regular prenatal visits. Most women have check-ups about once a month in the beginning. Then, they go more often later in the pregnancy.

During a prenatal visit, your provider will ask about your health history. They will also perform a physical exam and weight check. They’ll let you know how much weight gain is healthy for your body and help track your progress.

You’ll also be asked to provide a urine sample. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common during pregnancy. UTIs and other infections increase the risk of having a preterm birth. This is when you give birth at 37 weeks or earlier.

“One of the primary purposes of prenatal care is actually prevention,” says Longo. “We screen women to find potential health problems before those issues can worsen.”

During certain stages of pregnancy, your provider will perform blood tests and imaging tests. These include ultrasound exams to look at the baby’s growth and development. Visits are also an opportunity to talk with your provider about how to give your baby a healthy start.

“During prenatal visits, we educ-ate and counsel moms about healthy habits, healthy food choices, and exercise,” Longo says. “We also address any concerns a new mom-to-be might have.”

Taking a prenatal vitamin is also key. Folic acid is included in most prenatal vitamins. It reduces the risk of severe birth defects that affect the developing brain and spine.

It’s important to stay away from things that could harm your baby. These include certain medications, smoking, and alcoholic drinks. Also, talk with your provider about any health conditions. Conditions like diabetes (a disease that causes high blood sugar) and high blood pressure need to be brought under control.

Some women choose to talk with their provider before becoming pregnant. This is called a preconception visit. It can help you plan for a safer pregnancy.

Early and regular care for you and your developing baby is important. Studies show that prenatal care reduces the risk of having a low-birth weight baby. Low birth weight can cause health problems. Even during the pandemic, it’s essential to keep up with regular prenatal care.

“Providers around the globe have adapted prenatal care to fit the current challenges,” says Longo. That means using telehealth for visits that don’t have to be done in person.

Health care providers are also seeing fewer patients and extending the time between them. This reduces possible exposure in waiting rooms.

“Providers are prepared for these difficult times,” says Longo. So it’s crucial that moms-to-be keep up with prenatal care.",newsinhealth.nih.gov
45,Dr. Kenneth Wright on Shift Work and Sleep,"Q&A

Dr. Kenneth Wright on Shift Work and Sleep

Kenneth P. Wright, Jr., PhD, Professor of Distinction, Director, Sleep and Chronobiology Laboratory, University of Colorado Boulder

Excerpts from our conversation with Dr. Kenneth Wright, Jr., an NIH-funded expert on sleep at the University of Colorado, Boulder.

NIHNiH: What is the circadian system? And why is it disrupted by shift work, such as working the night shift?

Wright: The circadian system is our biological clock. That biological clock controls the timing of a lot of our behaviors. These include when you choose to eat and when you choose to be active. For humans, our bodies are programmed to eat food during the daytime, not at nighttime, and be physically active during the daytime and not at nighttime.

For example, look at a hormone called melatonin. Our clock tells the body when to produce melatonin. And high levels of melatonin signal our biological night. Humans are not meant to be eating when melatonin levels are high.

So when we don’t get enough sleep, we are awake when melatonin levels are high. And if we eat during that time, that is associated with impairments in our blood sugar.

That’s one example, but the same goes for any system in our body. We can show that if you don’t get enough sleep, or if your circadian clock is disturbed, that system will be dysregulated in one way or another.

NIHNiH: What kinds of problems can disrupting your circadian clock cause?

Wright: Long-term disruption of circadian patterns can lead to weight gain, to obesity. It can lead to the development of depression or worsening of it. It can lead to type 2 diabetes, it can lead to heart disease and stroke. It can lead to cancer. And when I say lead to, I mean it’s going to impact a lot of those fundamental processes in the body that contribute to these disorders.

NIHNiH: What advice do you give to people who work the night shift or other shifts that could throw off their biological clocks?

Wright: Shift work is a challenge because it really goes against our fundamental biology. But there are specific tips that we can give to people who do shift work.

One of them is to try to maximize your 24-hour total sleep time. What I mean by that is, say after a night shift a worker goes home, is awake for a little bit, and then goes to sleep. They may sleep for five or six hours. And then they wake up, because the clock in their brain tells them it’s time to be awake, not because they got enough sleep.

So what we what recommend is you get that five or six hours. And then you take about a two-hour nap before you go back to work. That will get you closer to that seven or eight hours of recommended sleep.

There’s also a huge population of shift workers that we tend not to focus on. Those are the early morning shift workers, people who start work before 7 am. They’ve got to go to bed earlier than normal, which can induce insomnia. They can try things like taking melatonin to try to go to bed earlier, or exposure to bright lights to try to shift their clock earlier.

Waking up around the same time every day is also important even for shift workers, because it’s a strong signal for our circadian clock. The more irregular you are, if your wake times are bouncing around every day and on the weekends, that’s associated with a lot of health problems.",newsinhealth.nih.gov

Antibodies Protect Against COVID-19 Reinfection

NIAID

After having COVID-19, most people’s bodies develop antibodies to help fight it off. These are special molecules made by the body’s disease defense system, the immune system. A study found that people with these antibodies were less likely to get COVID-19 again.

Researchers looked at more than 3 million people who had an antibody test for SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes COVID-19.

They found that about 11% of people had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. More than 88% had a negative test. And less than 1% of tests were inconclusive.

The scientists looked at who came down with COVID-19 after the test. They analyzed up to 30 days, 31–60 days, 61–90 days, and more than 90 days after.

About 3% to 4% of people with negative antibody tests got COVID-19 in each time period. But those who had antibodies were less likely to have COVID-19 as time went on. Only 0.3% of the people with antibodies had a positive COVID-19 test more than 90 days after. Those without antibodies were 10 times more likely to get the disease.

The findings suggest that people who have a positive result from an antibody test may be at lower risk for future infection with SARS-CoV-2.

NIH’s Dr. Lynn Penberthy, who led the research team, explains that more questions still need to be answered. “We are nevertheless encouraged by this early finding,” she says.",newsinhealth.nih.gov

Dr. Chandra Jackson on COVID-19 and Sleep

Video of Coping with COVID-19: Sleep and Health

Excerpts from a conversation between Dr. Marishka Brown at NIH and Dr. Chandra Jackson, an NIH expert on sleep.

Brown: From a sleep perspective, how is the COVID-19 pandemic affecting people?

Jackson: Before the pandemic, at least a third of Americans were not getting the recommended amount of at least seven hours of sleep per day. And before the coronavirus, millions of people suffered from sleep disorders like insomnia.

It’s likely that the stress many of us had before the pandemic has now increased. For instance, if people already felt isolated and depressed, it could be more difficult now to cope. Some may also feel greater financial strain, or job and housing insecurity.

Many new challenges have also emerged. One is being or knowing an essential worker on the front lines, whether a medical doctor, nurse, or a cashier at a grocery store. This can induce anxiety, which we know negatively affects sleep.

Also, our routines have been disrupted. Keeping track of time can be difficult. Other major challenges relate to not being able to cut off work at the end of the workday because you’re at home. Or trying to manage the house with children who are used to being at school and may be getting too much screen time.

All of these factors many of us have been dealing with can cause stress and strain. Those have been shown to negatively affect sleep. Additionally, simply staying in the house versus going outside can greatly lower your exposure to natural light. And lack of natural light can reduce biological signals that are important for sleep at night.

Brown: How does sleep impact the immune systemThe system that protects your body from invading viruses, bacteria, and other microscopic threats.?

Jackson: Good sleep helps support the immune system. Disrupted sleep can reduce circulating cytokines, which are a type of protein that helps protect against infection. This clearly has implications for being able to ward off infectious agents like coronavirus.

And if you’re actually sick for whatever reason, resting your body seems to help you recover faster. Lastly, chronic sleep deprivation has also been shown to make vaccines less effective, by reducing the body’s ability to respond.

Brown: Can you speak to the role of disparities and sleep, and its interplay with COVID-19?

Jackson: Unfavorable sleep is common in the general population to begin with. But individuals who are Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Native American, and even sexual and gender minorities have been shown to be disproportionately burdened by poor sleep. Social stress is generally believed to be the connection across these different but intersecting social identity groups.

In terms of sleep disorders, the most common are obstructive sleep apnea and insomnia. Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, and Asian populations suffer disproportionately from obstructive sleep apnea. A lot of these disparities appear to start early in life. For instance, Black compared to white children have been shown to have a four to six times higher prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing. This is attributed not to genetics, but to living in economically deprived communities with relevant environmental hazards.

So sleep disparities are clearly relevant to the pandemic. They likely contribute to disparities in conditions like diabetes and heart disease. And these are conditions that we know increase susceptibility to poor outcomes related to COVID-19.

Additionally, the mental stress from COVID that we’re all feeling is likely exacerbating existing sleep disparities, because disadvantaged groups are disproportionately affected by the virus for largely social reasons. For instance, racial/ethnic minority groups are more likely to have service-oriented, essential, frontline, and often risky, low wage jobs without worker protections like paid sick leave.

48,Why You Should Not Use Ivermectin to Treat or Prevent COVID-19,"Image

Español Português 中文 Tagalog Tiếng Việt 한국어

COVID-19. We’ve been living with it for what sometimes seems like forever. Given the number of deaths that have occurred from the disease, it’s perhaps not surprising that some consumers are looking at unconventional treatments, not approved or authorized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Though this is understandable, please beware. The FDA’s job is to carefully evaluate the scientific data on a drug to be sure that it is both safe and effective for a particular use, and then to decide whether or not to approve it. Using any treatment for COVID-19 that’s not approved or authorized by the FDA, unless part of a clinical trial, can cause serious harm.

There seems to be a growing interest in a drug called ivermectin to treat humans with COVID-19. Ivermectin is often used in the U.S. to treat or prevent parasites in animals. The FDA has received multiple reports of patients who have required medical support and been hospitalized after self-medicating with ivermectin intended for horses.

Here’s What You Need to Know about Ivermectin

FDA has not approved ivermectin for use in treating or preventing COVID-19 in humans. Ivermectin tablets are approved at very specific doses for some parasitic worms, and there are topical (on the skin) formulations for head lice and skin conditions like rosacea. Ivermectin is not an anti-viral (a drug for treating viruses).

Taking large doses of this drug is dangerous and can cause serious harm.

If you have a prescription for ivermectin for an FDA-approved use, get it from a legitimate source and take it exactly as prescribed.

Never use medications intended for animals on yourself. Ivermectin preparations for animals are very different from those approved for humans.

What is Ivermectin and How is it Used?

Ivermectin tablets are approved by the FDA to treat people with intestinal strongyloidiasis and onchocerciasis, two conditions caused by parasitic worms. In addition, some topical (on the skin) forms of ivermectin are approved to treat external parasites like head lice and for skin conditions such as rosacea.

Some forms of ivermectin are used in animals to prevent heartworm disease and certain internal and external parasites. It’s important to note that these products are different from the ones for people, and safe when used as prescribed for animals, only.

When Can Taking Ivermectin Be Unsafe?

The FDA has not reviewed data to support use of ivermectin in COVID-19 patients to treat or to prevent COVID-19; however, some initial research is underway. Taking a drug for an unapproved use can be very dangerous. This is true of ivermectin, too.

There’s a lot of misinformation around, and you may have heard that it’s okay to take large doses of ivermectin. That is wrong.

Even the levels of ivermectin for approved uses can interact with other medications, like blood-thinners. You can also overdose on ivermectin, which can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hypotension (low blood pressure), allergic reactions (itching and hives), dizziness, ataxia (problems with balance), seizures, coma and even death.

Ivermectin Products for Animals Are Different from Ivermectin Products for People

For one thing, animal drugs are often highly concentrated because they are used for large animals like horses and cows, which can weigh a lot more than we do—a ton or more. Such high doses can be highly toxic in humans.

Moreover, FDA reviews drugs not just for safety and effectiveness of the active ingredients, but also for the inactive ingredients. Many inactive ingredients found in animal products aren’t evaluated for use in people. Or they are included in much greater quantity than those used in people. In some cases, we don’t know how those inactive ingredients will affect how ivermectin is absorbed in the human body.

Meanwhile, effective ways to limit the spread of COVID-19 continue to be to wear your mask, stay at least 6 feet from others who don’t live with you, wash hands frequently, and avoid crowds.

Telemental health is the use of telecommunications or videoconferencing technology to provide mental health services. It is sometimes referred to as telepsychiatry or telepsychology. Research suggests that telemental health services can be effective for many people, including, but not limited to those with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety.

As the need for providing virtual mental health care services has increased, providers are finding ways to use phone and videoconferencing technology to bring therapy, evaluations, interventions, and medication management to individuals where they are.

Although the practice has become much more common, especially as a result of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, more research is needed to understand when and how telemental health services should be used.

Community Supports for Rural Aging in Place and Independent Living

Older adults (those aged 65 and older) and people with disabilities have unique healthcare needs and often face challenges to meeting these needs. In addition, accessible housing, transportation, employment, educational programs, and specialized healthcare may be limited in many parts of rural America. Community organizations, healthcare facilities, local governments, and other rural entities can help older adults and people with disabilities by collaborating and creatively using limited resources to provide needed services.

This guide includes information about home-based services and community supports available to support aging in place and independent living and discusses challenges for people receiving services and those providing them. For information related to services for veterans with service-related injuries, see Rural Veterans and Access to Healthcare.

Frequently Asked Questions

What types of services and supports can help rural residents to age in place and live independently, and who delivers these services?

Older individuals and people with disabilities may experience physical limitations and need to rely on others for help with activities of daily living. This can be particularly challenging in rural areas. Home and Community-Based Alternatives to Nursing Home Care notes that a wide range of services can help individuals live independently. Types of services that can support aging in place and independent living include, but are not limited to:

Family caregivers, community business and nonprofit organizations, paid home care workers, senior centers, tribal organizations, and volunteers can all provide help to people in rural communities. However, home health services, which are specifically medical in nature, must be provided by skilled medical professionals.

The National Academy for State Health Policy's 2019 Toolkit: State Strategies to Support Older Adults Aging in Place in Rural Areas describes a variety of state initiatives designed to help older rural adults remain in their communities. SASH® (Support and Services at Home) utilizes affordable housing communities throughout Vermont to provide care and services to older adults and individuals with disabilities and promote independent living. The ARcare Aging Well Outreach Network, run by the ARcare Federally Qualified Health Center, provides services including falls prevention assessments, transportation to appointments, medication management, and senior-specific exercise opportunities for Cross County, Arkansas residents over 50 years of age.

For additional examples of home-based services and community supports in rural communities, see the RHIhub's Rural Aging in Place and Access to Care for Rural People with Disabilities Toolkits.

What other services and supports might people with disabilities need in order to live successfully in a rural community?

People with disabilities may use some of the same services and supports as older adults to be able to live independently in rural areas. However, rural residents with disabilities may also benefit from other services and supports. For example, they may experience pain and other secondary conditions that may make it difficult to hold a job. As a result, people with disabilities may need specialized training or rehabilitation services or other assistance to overcome barriers to employment or pursue self-employment. Farm Assessment and Rehabilitation Methods (FARM) Program is one example of a program designed to help disabled farmers continue or resume farming or find an alternative agricultural occupation.

People with disabilities may also need assistance connecting with community services and supports as they transition from a facility back into the community or as they transition into adulthood. Centers for Independent Living (CILs) provide individuals with disabilities with services to help them live independently, including referrals, independent living skills training, and peer counseling. CILs can also offer additional services, including job search support, assistive technology information, and housing option counseling.

People with disabilities and functional limitations also require additional supports in emergency situations. Individuals who are hard of hearing may not hear sirens or other audible alerts, while those with vision impairments may not see flashing lights or other signals. In an emergency, people who use assistive technologies or durable medical equipment may need access to back-up sources of power. Additionally, people with functional disabilities may need accessible transportation options or shelters if evacuation is necessary. For information on preparing and responding to emergencies in rural communities, see RHIhub's Rural Emergency Preparedness and Response topic guide.

Why is it important for people living in rural areas to have access to home-based services and community supports?

Older adults and people with disabilities living in rural areas, like their urban counterparts, typically prefer to live in their own homes, rather than in assisted living facilities or nursing homes. While they may be able to thrive in the community, older adults and individuals with disabilities may also need some assistance in carrying out key everyday activities such as bathing or cooking. Similarly, Differences in Social Isolation and Its Relationship to Health by Rurality highlights that while older adults in rural areas report larger social networks than their urban counterparts, they experience increased risks of social isolation and loneliness. Social isolation among older adults has been linked to poor health outcomes and increased healthcare spending. As a result, rural areas may need to provide additional services and supports to keep older adults and people with disabilities included and active in community life. Older adults and people with disabilities may also face additional challenges in rural areas related to:

Transportation to medical appointments, grocery shopping, and other essential and leisure activities

Housing quality and affordability, including how to pay for needed repairs, modifications, and assistive technologies that would allow them to continue to live safely in the home

Availability of home-based services and community supports in their communities that will allow them to live independently at home.

Paid caregiver workforce shortages.

Support for informal caregivers to prevent feelings of isolation and burnout.

Meeting the Social Needs of Older Adults in Rural Areas demonstrates how home-based services and community supports can foster social connections as well as connect residents with needs and services that promote health and wellness.

What are livable communities, and how do they facilitate aging in place and independent living in rural communities?

Livable communities meet the full range of needs of all its residents. Partners for Livable Communities defines livability as “the sum of the factors that add up to a community's quality of life—including the built and natural environments, economic prosperity, social stability and equity, educational opportunity, and cultural, entertainment and recreation possibilities.” AARP also notes that a livable community will “enhance personal independence; allow residents to remain in their homes and communities; and foster residents' engagement in the community's civic, economic, and social life.” As a result, the exact characteristics of livability will be unique to each community.

The terms “aging in place” and “independent living” describe different aspects of livable communities. People who want to age in place are those who want to remain in a place of their choice, typically one in which they have invested time and money, where they have an informal support network and which holds fond memories for them. There are typically fewer housing options available in rural communities, making it difficult to downsize or find accessible housing. Also, home repairs or modifications may be necessary for an individual to remain in their community. Similarly, nutrition services may be necessary for adults who cannot safely cook for themselves. For more information on aging in place in rural communities, see the RHIhub's Rural Aging in Place Toolkit.

The term independent living can simply refer to an arrangement in which people with disabilities live in a community rather than in an institutional setting. Interpreted more broadly, it is a philosophy which promotes the idea that people with disabilities have the same civil rights as people without disabilities, and should make their own decisions about how they will live, work, and participate in society in the least restrictive environment. This approach focuses on ensuring that communities meet the needs of all people who live there.

Universal design principles should be considered when designing rural infrastructure. Universal design goes beyond meeting accessibility standards and seeks to address usability concerns for people of all ages and abilities throughout the entire design of a building or community. Curb cuts are one example of universal design. Originally designed to improve access for individuals with mobility and visual impairments, curb cuts also assist cyclists, families with strollers, and travelers with luggage, among many others.

By embracing the concepts of aging in place, independent living, and universal design, communities can help individuals remain and thrive in their homes or community setting of their choice, no matter their age or ability. For information on evidence-based and promising models and resources to support organizations and communities in creating rural livable communities, see the RHIhub's Rural Aging in Place and Access to Care for Rural People with Disabilities Toolkits.

What resources are available to find services for older adults and individuals with disabilities who wish to remain in their homes?

The National Institute on Aging's webpage Aging in Place: Growing Old at Home offers suggestions for planning ahead to stay at home, lists the kinds of supports that may be needed, and offers contact information for various agencies and programs that can provide help and guidance. It notes that resources can include:

Friends, family, and neighbors

Community businesses and nonprofit organizations

Geriatric care managers

Senior centers

Area Agencies on Aging

Tribal organizations

Federal, state, and local government resources

The World Health Organization defines age-friendly environments as ones that:

“foster health and well-being and the participation of people as they age. They are accessible, equitable, inclusive, safe and secure, and supportive. They promote health and prevent or delay the onset of disease and functional decline. They provide people-centered services and support to enable recovery or to compensate for the loss of function so that people can continue to do the things that are important to them.”

Centers for Independent Living are community-based, consumer-controlled nonprofit organizations funded by the Administration for Community Living (ACL) to provide individuals with disabilities a range of services to promote independent living. While CILs can offer more services, they are required to provide information and referral services, independent living skills training, peer counseling, and services that facilitate transition from nursing homes and other institutions to the community. ACL maintains a state-by-state list of Centers for Independent Living.

The Grantmakers in Aging publication Guiding Principles for the Sustainability of Age-Friendly Community Efforts notes that “Champions for age-friendly communities can be found in neighborhoods, elected offices, non-profit organizations, universities, and businesses.” Churches and local nonprofit organizations may be helpful in providing services or referrals. Age-Friendly and Dementia-Friendly Winnemucca and Humboldt County describes how the rural community of Winnemucca, Nevada, worked to create an age-friendly and dementia-friendly community that expanded to Humboldt County.

The National PACE (Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly) Association supports and promotes programs that provide comprehensive medical care and community-based services to help older people live as independently as possible for as long as possible. RHIhub's Rural Services Integration Toolkit highlights the work of Senior CommUnity Care (Delta and Montrose Counties, Colorado), an example of a rural PACE program. For a list of currently operating PACE centers, search Find a PACE Program in Your Neighborhood.

The Eldercare Locator, 1.800.677.1116, provides access to state and local Area Agencies on Aging, as well as community-based organizations and services addressing a range of concerns, including housing, transportation, elder abuse prevention, and more. Churches and civic groups may also be able to make referrals to local sources for services.

What are the workforce and training challenges related to providing home-based services and community supports?

State Solutions to the Home Care Workforce Crisis in Rural America notes that many workers providing home-based services in rural areas work only part-time, earning less on average than workers in urban areas. According to the report Preventing Caregiver Turnover, low wages are a major factor in the high turnover rate among home care workers. This results in a heavier workload for employees who do remain, and creates losses in productivity, morale problems, and a lack of care management. In addition, National Survey of Area Agencies on Aging 2020 Report: Meeting the Needs of Today's Older Adults reports that workforce challenges have resulted in 62% of AAAs delaying the start of services for individuals, 59% increasing the size of staff caseloads, and 49% starting or extending waitlists for services.

As more medical care for people with multiple chronic conditions takes place in the home, the care provided in the home becomes more complex and requires additional skills. As described in the Government Accountability Office report Medicaid Home- and Community-Based Services: Selected States' Program Structures and Challenges Providing Services, recipients of home- and community-based services may have complex medical and behavioral needs and may display aggressive behaviors. In response, some organizations may offer specialized behavioral health training to help workers deal with these situations appropriately.

What does a lack of home-based services and community supports in a community mean for older adults, people with disabilities, and their families?

Caregiving in the U.S. 2020, a report from AARP and the National Alliance for Caregiving, offers a national profile of unpaid family caregivers for rural adults. Notably, family caregivers of older adults living in rural areas often do not live in a rural area themselves and continue to work while serving as a primary caregiver. The report also highlights that caregivers are likely to find it difficult to find available, affordable services in rural communities.

The report Transportation, Distance, and Health Care Utilization for Older Adults in Rural and Small Urban Areas notes that people who do not have access to reliable transportation are more likely to delay getting needed healthcare or forego it entirely. This can result in a need for emergency care or a hospitalization that could otherwise have been avoided. For more information on the consequences of a lack of transportation for rural residents who have disabilities or are older, see the RHIhub Transportation to Support Rural Healthcare topic guide.

Rural people who are unable to find necessary supports in their community may have little choice but to relocate to a nursing home. According to the policy brief Are Rural Older Adults Benefiting from Increased State Spending on Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services?, rural Medicaid beneficiaries were more likely to use skilled nursing facilities than urban Medicaid beneficiaries. Similarly, Rural Long-Term Services and Supports: A Primer describes how rural residential care facilities, such as assisted living facilities, serve populations with more diverse needs than facilities in urban areas. This may reflect that there are few long-term care options in rural areas, in addition to the possible lack of other support services in the community.

How can home-based services and community supports help informal caregivers?

The August 2019 publication Supportive Services and Caregiving for Rural Adults: Policy Brief and Recommendations to the Secretary from the National Advisory Committee on Rural Health and Human Services (NACRHHS) notes that nearly 44 million family and friends serve as informal, unpaid caregivers to older adults and individuals with disabilities each year. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one in four rural adults provide care or assistance to a friend or family member with a health concern or disability. Over half of these caregivers provide care for over two years, and 30% spend at least 20 hours per week providing care. As a result, informal caregivers can incur psychological, physical, and financial stress when caring for another individual.

Home-based services and community supports can benefit friend and family caregivers as well as patients. For example, reliable, accessible transportation services can allow caregivers to maintain regular work hours with the peace of mind that their loved ones can visit grocery stores, attend community centers, or travel to medical appointments. The Missouri Rural Health Association's HealthTran program coordinates non-emergency medical transportation for individuals who need routine and preventative medical care. Similarly, adult day centers provide supervised care to dependent adults, relieving caregivers from attending to their family members continuously throughout the day.

The policy brief Perspectives on Rural Caregiving Challenges and Interventions examines strategies for supporting informal caregivers. Key informants noted that increased financial support, development of a national strategy, and expanded access to resources would all be beneficial for informal caregivers. On a local level, the following strategies are helpful:

Increase awareness of caregivers' needs through workplace programs and churches

Provide infrastructure to enable rural families to more easily access technology services

Offer training to caregivers, so that they will feel more prepared and confident in their ability to help loved ones

Improve Medicaid services

Expand family leave policies and economic incentives for caregivers

Offer screening for caregiver depression and isolation

The 2019 Milbank Memorial Fund report In Support of Family Caregivers: A Snapshot of Five States notes that as demographics change and the country has a larger percentage of older Americans, there will be a need for public policies to support family and unpaid caregivers. For example, the Maine housing administration provides up to $3,800 in tax credits for home modifications for older adults, and Minnesota used grant funding from its Live Well at Home program to partner with Chicago REST (Respite Education Support Tools) to increase the availability of respite care for caregivers.

Resources for Caregiving in Rural Communities gives descriptions and contact information for several national and state-level programs that provide services.

For more information on the challenges and opportunities informal caregivers experience in adopting technology to aid their caregiving efforts, read the Rural Monitor article Informal Caregiving and Technology in Rural America.

What is the Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services Waiver Program?

In the past, long-term support services funded by Medicaid have typically been delivered in nursing facilities or other institutions. However, Medicaid's home and community-based services waivers (HCBS or 1915(c) Waivers) allow states to develop programs to meet needs of Medicaid beneficiaries who want to remain in their own homes or communities. States can apply for multiple waivers to tailor programs and services to specific groups identified by age or diagnosis. Waiver programs must:

Show that the services provided under the waiver will not cost more than the same services provided in an institution.

Ensure that people's health and welfare will be protected

Establish standards for providers to meet the needs of the participants

Develop and follow a plan of care that is individualized and person-centered

Key State Policy Choices About Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services highlights the variation in how these services are provided at the state level. However, Are Rural Older Adults Benefiting from Increased State Spending on Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services?, a 2016 report from the Maine Rural Health Research Center, examines how urban and rural older adults utilize these services differently.

For more information, see Medicaid's Home & Community-Based Services 1915(c).

What other funding opportunities are available for rural home-based services and community supports?

Local agencies such as Area Agencies on Aging, Aging and Disability Resource Centers, Centers for Independent Living and nonprofit or faith-based organizations are often the best funding sources for rural home-based services. For a list of grant programs and organizations that have funded activities to support aging in place and independent living, see the Funding & Opportunities section of this topic guide.

What are some food and nutrition programs for seniors in rural communities who spend most of their time at home?

The Administration for Community Living's Administration on Aging administers the Nutrition Services Program, which provides grants to states to promote nutrition services programs for older adults. These include:

Home-delivered meals

Meals served in group settings, such as community centers

Nutrition screening

Assessment

Education

Counseling

The programs are intended to reach people age 60 and above who have the greatest social and economic needs. Section 339 of the Older Americans Act of 1965 provides nutrition services programs the ability to also serve spouses of any age, people who provide volunteer services during meal hours, and people with disabilities. Priority is given to the following groups:

Low-income adults

Members of minority groups

Seniors in rural areas

Seniors who have limited proficiency in English

Seniors at risk for needing institutional care

According to the Administration on Community Living (ACL), “home-delivered meals are often the first in-home service that an older adult receives, and the program is a primary access point for other home and community-based services.” A 2015 research brief, Older Americans Benefit from Older Americans Act Nutrition Programs, highlights the connection between the health and ability of recipients of these services to remain at home.

Meals on Wheels America has more than two million staff members and volunteers who deliver meals to frail, homebound, or isolated seniors. The organization notes on its website that it serves “virtually every community in America,” and provides funding, leadership, education, research, and advocacy support.

Some rural communities have food pantries, which may provide food and other basic products. The Rural Monitor article Food Pantries Serving More and More of the Rural Poor gives examples of rural food pantry programs which are funded by federal programs, state governments, foundations, businesses, religious organizations, and individuals.

For more information about nutrition programs for rural seniors, see RHIhub's Rural Hunger and Access to Healthy Food topic guide.

Where can I find information on community-based transportation services?

People in rural areas often have difficulty finding adequate transportation. Those with medical needs requiring specialized care available only in larger communities may find it particularly challenging to access affordable, long-distance transportation to these locations.

The National Aging and Disability Transportation Center (NADTC), a partnership between the Federal Transit Administration, Easterseals, and the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging, promotes transportation availability and accessibility for older adults, people with disabilities, and their caregivers. It offers training and webinars, and Resources & Publications that are available for download.

The National Rural Transit Assistance Program Directory of State RTAP Managers offers a searchable directory of state Rural Transit Assistance Program managers, and VirtualCAP provides information and resources used by Community Action Agencies to help people become self-sufficient in rural and urban areas.

Español 中文 한국의 Tagalog Tiếng Việt

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized three COVID-19 vaccines for emergency use. The vaccines are:

Emergency use authorization (EUA) allows these vaccines to be distributed in the U.S. Learn more about EUAs for COVID-19 vaccines from the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER).

Who authorizes COVID-19 vaccines for emergency use?

The FDA is the authority that has regulatory oversight of the safety, effectiveness and quality of vaccines that are used in the U.S., including COVID-19 vaccines. FDA employees who are career scientists and doctors are the people who decided to authorize COVID-19 vaccines after they thoroughly analyzed and evaluated the data on COVID-19 vaccine safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality.

The FDA may issue an EUA when the agency’s scientific experts have determined that the known and potential benefits of the vaccine outweigh its known and potential risks. FDA employees are fathers, mothers, daughters, sons, sisters, brothers and more. They and their families are directly impacted by the work they do.

Why should I get a COVID-19 vaccine?

When you get a COVID-19 vaccine, you are choosing to protect yourself and make a difference for your children, parents, grandparents, and other loved ones. Millions of people in the U.S. have already received a COVID-19 vaccine. For a community to be fully protected, most community members need to get the vaccine. Getting vaccinated to prevent COVID-19 will help protect you from COVID-19, and it may also protect the people around you.

How do I get a COVID-19 vaccine?

Go to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website to find your state and local health departments who are responsible for COVID-19 vaccine distribution. All questions and concerns should be sent to your state government or local health department. The U.S. government’s goal is to have enough COVID-19 vaccine doses for all people in the U.S. who choose to be vaccinated.

FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines are being distributed for free by states and local communities. If you see vaccines for sale online, or if someone asks you for money to get a vaccine appointment, to put your name on a waiting list, or to get access to a vaccine, it is a scam. You do not need to pay to get a vaccine appointment or to be put on a waiting list.

Do the COVID-19 vaccines work?

Yes. All three FDA-authorized vaccines are effective in preventing COVID-19 and related serious outcomes, including hospitalization and deaths. The FDA thoroughly evaluated and analyzed the safety and effectiveness data for all of the authorized COVID-19 vaccines and determined that the available data for each vaccine provides clear evidence that the known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks of each vaccine.

Do the COVID-19 vaccines work against the new variants?

The available information suggests that the authorized vaccines remain effective in protecting the American public against currently circulating strains of COVID-19. We are already talking with vaccine manufacturers about these new strains and how to quickly and safely make any changes that may be needed in the future.

Some variants spread more easily than others and are more transmissible than the original virus that causes COVID-19. To help slow the spread of COVID-19, get a COVID-19 vaccine when it is available to you. Other ways to slow the spread include:

Wearing a mask

Keeping 6 feet apart from others who don’t live with you

Avoiding crowds and poorly ventilated indoor spaces

Washing your hands often with soap and water (use hand sanitizer if soap and water aren’t available)

How safe are the COVID-19 vaccines?

The FDA evaluated data from clinical studies that included tens of thousands of people for each COVID-19 vaccine. The FDA authorized the vaccines because the data from these studies clearly showed that the known and potential benefits of the FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines outweighed the known and potential risks.



Report vaccine side effects toll-free at 1-800-822-7967 or online to FDA/CDC Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).

Millions of doses of FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines have been given to people all around the country. Serious adverse events following vaccination are very rare. Allergic reactions, some of which are severe, and cases of anaphylaxis have occurred following administration of COVID-19 vaccines. Anaphylaxis is a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction that happens within seconds or minutes of exposure to an allergen. Because of this remote chance of severe allergic reaction or anaphylaxis, health care providers may ask you to stay at the place where you received your COVID-19 vaccine for monitoring for 15 to 30 minutes.

For one vaccine, the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine, there have been cases reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) of a type of blood clot called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) in combination with low levels of platelets in the blood (thrombocytopenia). CVST occurs when a blood clot forms in the brain's venous sinuses. This prevents blood from draining out of the brain. It is a type of rare stroke.

On April 13, 2021, the FDA and CDC recommended a pause in the use of this vaccine out of an abundance of caution while it further investigates these cases and to ensure that the health care provider community is aware of the potential for these adverse events and can plan for proper recognition and management due to the unique treatment required with this type of blood clot.

Can I see the safety and effectiveness data that support the Emergency Use Authorization of the COVID-19 vaccines?

The FDA is publicly sharing information about COVID-19 vaccines so you can see the evidence for yourself. The FDA’s analysis of clinical trial data, as well as demographic information about the clinical study volunteers, is available in the FDA Briefing Document for each vaccine. You can also view the advisory committee webcasts where outside experts discuss the data. The FDA’s reasoning for authorizing each vaccine is available in the FDA Decision Memorandum.

Does the FDA monitor COVID-19 vaccine safety after authorization?

Yes. The FDA and the CDC have several systems in place to continually monitor COVID-19 vaccine safety. These systems, called “passive surveillance” and “active surveillance” systems, rapidly detect and investigate potential safety problems. Systems such as the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and CDC’s text-based v-safe system, which receive reports of adverse events following vaccination, are examples of passive surveillance systems. The FDA‘s BEST Initiative is an example of an active surveillance system, which can rapidly analyze information occurring in millions of individuals recorded in large data systems to investigate any safety signals that are identified by VAERS or v-safe.

54,How Radiation Therapy Is Used to Treat Cancer,"How Radiation Therapy Is Used to Treat Cancer

Radiation is one of the most common treatments for cancer. Other names for radiation treatment are radiation therapy, radiotherapy, irradiation, and x-ray therapy.

What is radiation therapy?

Radiation therapy uses high-energy particles or waves, such as x-rays, gamma rays, electron beams, or protons, to destroy or damage cancer cells.

Your cells normally grow and divide to form new cells. But cancer cells grow and divide faster than most normal cells. Radiation works by making small breaks in the DNA inside cells. These breaks keep cancer cells from growing and dividing and cause them to die. Nearby normal cells can also be affected by radiation, but most recover and go back to working the way they should.

While chemotherapy and other treatments that are taken by mouth or injection usually expose the whole body to cancer-fighting drugs, radiation therapy is usually a local treatment. This means it’s usually aimed at and affects only the part of the body needing treatment. Radiation treatments are planned so that they damage cancer cells with as little harm as possible to nearby healthy cells.

Some radiation treatments (systemic radiation therapy) use radioactive substances that are given in a vein or by mouth. Even though this type of radiation does travel throughout the body, the radioactive substance mostly collects in the area of the tumor, so there’s still little effect on the rest of the body.

Who gets radiation therapy?

More than half of people with cancer get radiation therapy. Sometimes, radiation therapy is the only cancer treatment needed and sometimes it's used with other types of treatment. The decision to use radiation therapy depends on the type and stage of cancer, and other health problems a patient might have.

What are the goals of radiation therapy?

Most types of radiation therapy don’t reach all parts of the body, which means they’re not helpful in treating cancer that has spread to many places within the body. Still, radiation therapy can be used to treat many types of cancer either alone or in combination with other treatments. While it's important to remember each cancer and each person is different, radiation is often the treatment of choice for the following purposes.

To cure or shrink early-stage cancer

Some cancers are very sensitive to radiation. Radiation may be used by itself in these cases to make the cancer shrink or completely go away. In some cases, chemotherapy or other anti-cancer drugs may be given first. For other cancers, radiation may be used before surgery to shrink the tumor (this is called pre-operative therapy or neoadjuvant therapy), or after surgery to help keep the cancer from coming back (called adjuvant therapy).

For certain cancers that can be cured either by radiation or by surgery, radiation may be the preferred treatment. This is because radiation can cause less damage and the part of the body involved may be more likely to work the way it should after treatment.

For some types of cancer, radiation and chemotherapy or other types of anti-cancer drugs might be used together. Certain drugs (called radiosensitizers) help radiation work better by making cancer cells more sensitive to radiation. Research has shown that when anti-cancer drugs and radiation are given together for certain types of cancer, they can help each other work even better than if they were given alone. One drawback, though, is that side effects are often worse when they are given together.

To stop cancer from coming back (recurring) somewhere else

Cancer can spread from where it started to other body parts. Doctors often assume that a few cancer cells might already have spread even when they can’t be seen on imaging scans like CT scans or MRIs. In some cases, the area where the cancer most often spreads to may be treated with radiation to kill any cancer cells before they grow into tumors. For instance, people with certain kinds of lung cancer may get radiation to the head, even when there is no cancer known to be there, because their type of lung cancer often spreads to the brain. This is done to help prevent cancer from spreading to the head even before it can. Sometimes, radiation to prevent future cancer can be given at the same time that radiation is given to treat existing cancer, especially if the area the cancer might spread to is close to the tumor itself.

To treat symptoms caused by advanced cancer

Sometimes cancer has spread too much to be cured. But some of these tumors can still be treated to make them smaller so that the person can feel better. Radiation might help relieve problems like pain, trouble swallowing or breathing, or bowel blockages that can be caused by advanced cancer. This is called palliative radiation.

To treat cancer that has returned (recurred)

If a person's cancer has returned (recurred), radiation might be used to treat the cancer or to treat symptoms caused by advanced cancer. Whether radiation will be used after recurrence depends on many factors. For instance, if the cancer has come back in a part of the body that has already been treated with radiation, it might not be possible to give more radiation in the same place. It depends on the amount of radiation that was used before. In other instances, radiation might be used in the same area of the body or a different area. Some tumors do not respond as well to radiation, so radiation might not be used even if they recur.

How is radiation therapy given?

Radiation therapy can be given in 3 ways:

External radiation (or external beam radiation) : uses a machine that directs high-energy rays from outside the body into the tumor. It’s done during outpatient visits to a hospital or treatment center. It's usually given over many weeks and sometimes will be given twice a day for several weeks. A person receiving external radiation is not radioactive and does not have to follow special safety precautions at home.

uses a machine that directs high-energy rays from outside the body into the tumor. It’s done during outpatient visits to a hospital or treatment center. It's usually given over many weeks and sometimes will be given twice a day for several weeks. A person receiving external radiation is not radioactive and does not have to follow special safety precautions at home. Internal radiation: Internal radiation is also called brachytherapy. A radioactive source is put inside the body into or near the tumor. With some types of brachytherapy, radiation might be placed and left in the body to work. Sometimes it is placed in the body for a period of time and then removed. This is decided based on the type of cancer. Special safety precautions are needed for this type of radiation for a period of time. But it's important to know if the internal radiation is left in the body, after a while it eventually is no longer radioactive.

Internal radiation is also called brachytherapy. A radioactive source is put inside the body into or near the tumor. With some types of brachytherapy, radiation might be placed and left in the body to work. Sometimes it is placed in the body for a period of time and then removed. This is decided based on the type of cancer. Special safety precautions are needed for this type of radiation for a period of time. But it's important to know if the internal radiation is left in the body, after a while it eventually is no longer radioactive. Systemic radiation: Radioactive drugs given by mouth or put into a vein are used to treat certain types of cancer. These drugs then travel throughout the body. You might have to follow special precautions at home for a period of time after these drugs are given.

The type of radiation you might get depends on the kind of cancer you have and where it is. In some cases, more than one type is used. Your cancer care team can answer specific questions about the type of radiation prescribed for you, how it affects your body, and any precautions that may be needed.

Who gives radiation therapy treatments?

During your radiation therapy, a team of highly trained medical professionals will care for you. Your team may include these people:

Radiation oncologist: This doctor is specially trained to treat cancer with radiation. This person oversees your radiation treatment plan.

You may also need the services of a dietitian, physical therapist, social worker, dentist or dental oncologist, pharmacist, or other health care providers.

Does radiation therapy cause cancer?

It has long been known that radiation therapy can slightly raise the risk of getting another cancer. It’s one of the possible side effects of treatment that doctors have to think about when they weigh the benefits and risks of each treatment. For the most part, the risk of a second cancer from these treatments is small and is outweighed by the benefit of treating the cancer, but the risk is not zero. This is one of the many reasons each case is different and each person must be part of deciding which kind of treatment is right for them. The risk is different depending on where the radiation treatment will be in the body.

If your cancer care team recommends radiation treatment, it’s because they believe that the benefits you’ll get from it will outweigh the possible side effects. Still, this is your decision to make. Knowing as much as you can about the possible benefits and risks can help you be sure that radiation therapy is best for you.

Does radiation therapy affect pregnancy or fertility?

Females: It’s important not to become pregnant while getting radiation – it can harm the growing baby. If there’s a chance you might become pregnant, be sure to talk to your doctor about birth control options.

If you are or might be pregnant, let your doctor know right away.

If the area getting radiation in your body includes the ovaries, it is possible that the dose of radiation can cause the ovaries to no longer work (sterility), and that you would be unable to have children. it is important to know the risk of this possibility in advance of receiving radiation therapy. If you are thinking about radiation therapy that will affect the ovaries, talk to your doctor about how this might affect having children in the future.

Males: Not much is known about radiation’s effect on the children conceived by men while getting radiation therapy. Because of this, doctors often advise men to not get a woman pregnant during and for some weeks after treatment. Talk to your doctor to find out more about this.

If the area getting radiation includes the testicles, it is possible that the dose of radiation can cause the testicles to no longer work (sterility) and that you would be unable to have children. It is important to know the risk of this possibility in advance of receiving radiation therapy. There is no clear research about how sperm that is exposed to radiation affects future children made from that sperm. If you are thinking about radiation therapy that will affect the testicles, talk to your doctor about how this might affect having children in the future.

Questions to ask about radiation therapy

Before treatment, you’ll be asked to sign a consent form saying that your doctor has explained how radiation therapy may help, the possible risks, the type of radiation to be used, and your other treatment options. Before signing the consent form, be sure that you have had a chance to get all your questions answered. Here are some of the things you may want to ask about:",www.cancer.org
55,What Are mRNA Vaccines and How Do They Work?,"Vaccines help prepare the body to fight foreign invaders (pathogens such as bacteria or viruses), to prevent infection. All vaccines introduce into the body a harmless piece of a particular bacteria or virus, triggering an immune response. Most vaccines contain a weakened or killed bacteria or virus. However, scientists have developed a new type of vaccine that uses a molecule called messenger RNA (or mRNA for short) rather than part of an actual bacteria or virus. Messenger RNA is a type of RNA that is necessary for protein production. In cells, mRNA uses the information in genes to create a blueprint for making proteins. Once cells finish making a protein, they quickly break down the mRNA. mRNA from vaccines does not enter the nucleus and does not alter DNA.

mRNA vaccines work by introducing a piece of mRNA that corresponds to a viral protein, usually a small piece of a protein found on the virus’s outer membrane. (Individuals who get an mRNA vaccine are not exposed to the virus, nor can they become infected by it.) Using this mRNA blueprint, cells produce the viral protein. As part of a normal immune response, the immune system recognizes that the protein is foreign and produces specialized proteins called antibodies. Antibodies help protect the body against infection by recognizing individual viruses or other pathogens, attaching to them, and marking the pathogens for destruction. Once produced, antibodies remain in the body, even after the body has rid itself of the pathogen, so that the immune system can quickly respond if exposed again. If a person is exposed to a virus after receiving mRNA vaccination for it, antibodies can quickly recognize it, attach to it, and mark it for destruction before it can cause serious illness.

Like all vaccines in the United States, mRNA vaccines require authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before they can be used. Currently vaccines for COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, are the only authorized mRNA vaccines. These vaccines use mRNA that directs cells to produce copies of a protein on the outside of the coronavirus known as the “spike protein”. Researchers are studying how mRNA might be used to develop vaccines for additional infectious diseases.",medlineplus.gov

What is cerebral venous sinus thrombosis? Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) occurs when a blood clot forms in the brain’s venous sinuses. This prevents blood from draining out of the brain. As a result, blood cells may break and leak blood into the brain tissues, forming a hemorrhage. This chain of events is part of a stroke that can occur in adults and children. It can occur even in newborns and babies in the womb. A stroke can damage the brain and central nervous system. A stroke is serious and requires immediate medical attention. This condition may also be called cerebral sinovenous thrombosis. What causes cerebral venous sinus thrombosis? CVST is a rare form of stroke. It affects about 5 people in 1 million each year. The risk for this kind of stroke in newborns is greatest during the first month. Overall, about 3 out of 300,000 children and teens up to age 18 will have a stroke.

What are the risk factors for cerebral venous sinus thrombosis? Children and adults have different risk factors for CVST. Risk factors for children and infants include: Problems with the way their blood forms clots

Sickle cell anemia

Chronic hemolytic anemia

Beta-thalassemia major

Heart disease — either congenital (you're born with it) or acquired (you develop it)

Iron deficiency

Certain infections

Dehydration

Head injury

For newborns, a mother who had certain infections or a history of infertility Risk factors for adults include: Pregnancy and the first few weeks after delivery

Problems with blood clotting; for example, antiphospholipid syndrome, protein C and S deficiency, antithrombin III deficiency, lupus anticoagulant, or factor V Leiden mutation

Cancer

Collagen vascular diseases like lupus, Wegener’s granulomatosis, and Behcet syndrome

Obesity

Low blood pressure in the brain (intracranial hypotension)

Inflammatory bowel disease like Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis What are the symptoms of cerebral venous thrombosis? Symptoms of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis may vary, depending on the location of the thrombus. Responding quickly to these symptoms makes it more possible to recover. These are the physical symptoms that may occur: Headache

Blurred vision

Fainting or loss of consciousness

Loss of control over movement in part of the body

Seizures

Coma How is cerebral venous sinus thrombosis diagnosed? People who have had any type of stroke recover best if they get treatment immediately. If you suspect a stroke based on the symptoms, have someone take you immediately to the emergency room, or call 911 to get help. Doctors typically take a medical history and do a physical exam. Family and friends can describe the symptoms they saw, especially if the person who had the stroke is unconscious. The final diagnosis, however, is usually made based on how the blood is flowing in the brain. Imaging tests show areas of blood flow. These tests may be used to diagnose venous sinus thrombosis: MRI scan

CT scan

Venography

Angiography

Ultrasound

57,Recommendation to Pause Use of Johnson & Johnson's Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine,"Since use of COVID-19 vaccines began in the United States, scientists and doctors have constantly and carefully reviewed all reports of vaccine side effects and adverse events. As of April 23, 2021, more than 8 million doses of the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine had been given in the United States. As of April 23, 2021, experts reviewing safety reports for this vaccine found 15 reports of women who got the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine and later developed thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). TTS is a serious condition that involves blood clots with low platelets.

These reports suggest an increased risk of TTS one to two weeks after vaccination with the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. As of April 23, 2021, the reports reviewed all occurred in women between 18 and 59 years old, with a median of 37 years. These reports represent a reporting rate of 7 such events per 1 million vaccinations among women 18 through 49 years old and a rate of 0.9 per 1 million vaccinations among women 50 years and older. For all women, this is a rare adverse event. For women 50 years and older and men of all ages, the adverse event is even more rare. Reports show that symptoms of this adverse event started between 6 and 15 days after vaccination.",www.cdc.gov

What Is a Gene Mutation?

A gene mutation (myoo-TAY-shun) is a change in one or more genes. Some mutations can lead to genetic disorders or illnesses.

What Are Genes?

Genes are short sections of DNA. They determine our traits, which are things like hair color, height, body type, and other things that make a person unique. Genes also play a role in a person's risk for some diseases and health conditions. Each of us has about 24,000 different types of genes.

What Is DNA?

DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is the carrier of all our genes. Each person gets one copy of DNA from their mother and one copy from their father. DNA creates a code using four chemicals called nucleotides (NEW-klee-uh-tydes). This code determines which genes a person has. DNA is located inside the chromosomes.

What Is a Chromosome?

A chromosome (KRO-muh-sohm) is an X-shaped thread-like structure in the body's cells. It contains DNA. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes.

What Causes a Gene Mutation?

A gene can mutate because of:

a change in one or more nucleotides of DNA

a change in many genes

loss of one or more genes

rearrangement of genes or whole chromosomes

Do Parents Pass Gene Mutations to Children?

If a parent carries a gene mutation in their egg or sperm, it can pass to their child. These hereditary (or inherited) mutations are in almost every cell of the person's body throughout their life. Hereditary mutations include cystic fibrosis, hemophilia, and sickle cell disease.

Other mutations can happen on their own during a person's life. These are called sporadic, spontaneous, or new mutations. They affect only some cells. Damage from the sun's ultraviolet radiation or exposure to some types of chemicals can lead to new mutations. These mutations are not passed from parents to their children.

Do All Gene Mutations Cause Health Problems?

Most gene mutations have no effect on health. And the body can repair many mutations. Some mutations are even helpful. For example, people can have a mutation that protects them from heart disease or gives them harder bones.",kidshealth.org
59,Helping Your Child Heal after a Trauma,"

Larger text size Large text size Regular text size

Print

Parents do everything they can to protect their children. But sadly, many kids have gone through trauma.

A trauma is any event that is deeply upsetting, scary, or harmful. Things like abuse, violence, accidents, or natural disasters can be traumas. Becoming homeless, losing a parent, or a serious illness can be traumas too.

Traumas are serious events that cause kids to fear for their life or safety.

After a trauma, the emotional effects can last a long time. It can be hard to move on. For some kids, trauma can lead to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

But kids can recover after trauma. There is therapy that can help. Kids also need extra support and comfort from parents.

How Does Trauma Affect Kids?

Trauma affects a child's sense of safety and trust. After a trauma, kids can still feel tense or scared. Some feel alone, sad, angry, or guilty. They may think they are to blame for what happened to them. For some kids, there's a loss of self-esteem or dignity. For some, there's deep grief.

Trauma also can affect a child's mood, behavior, or sleep. Some kids become depressed. They might act grumpy or seem sad. Some get in trouble more often or do worse in school. Some have new fears or trouble sleeping. Some have upsetting memories, called flashbacks. Often, kids avoid things that remind them of what they've been through.

After a trauma, some kids share how they feel. But other kids keep things to themselves. They may try to hide how they feel, or try to push it out of their minds. They may think others expect them to ""get over it."" Some just don't have words for their feelings. For any of these reasons, a parent might not know what their child is going through.

How Does Therapy Help Kids Heal After a Trauma?

Therapy gives kids a way to safely share their feelings, tell their story, and get support. In therapy, kids learn to talk about what they've been through. They learn coping and calming skills. They learn to adjust the way they think and feel about the trauma. Slowly, they learn to face things they used to avoid. Therapy helps kids find their own courage and gain confidence.

Child therapy for trauma is called trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (or TF-CBT). Therapy includes talk, play, and learning activities that heal trauma.

TF-CBT helps parents too. It's natural for parents to feel upset about what their child has been through. In therapy, parents get the support they need. They get advice on how to help their child at home.

In TF-CBT, parents can play a big role in their child's healing. They are coached to listen in ways that help their child open up, talk, and feel close. They help their child practice coping skills at home. They share in the good feelings as their child makes progress.

How Can I Find Therapy for My Child?

Talk to your child's doctor. Let them know what your child has been through. The doctor cares about your child's mental health too.

Ask the doctor to refer you to a trained child therapist who can help. You might need to take your child to therapy once a week for a few months. But you'll see progress along the way.

How Can I Give My Child the Extra Support They Need?

After a trauma, kids need your support and comfort more than ever. Be sure to:

Spend time with your child. Do things that are soothing, relaxing, or fun. Cook together, take a walk, play, read, make art, or sing. Try to do this every day, even if it's only for a few minutes.

Do things that are soothing, relaxing, or fun. Cook together, take a walk, play, read, make art, or sing. Try to do this every day, even if it's only for a few minutes. Parent with patience and warmth. Use kind words. Give praise when your child is doing well or trying hard. Let your child know you're proud of them. Be patient when they make a mistake. Show them how to try again.

Use hugs, smiles, words, and caring actions to show your love. Use soothing words and offer comfort when your child is upset. Have soothing routines. Take a few minutes at bedtime (or any time) to read a story, snuggle together, or sing to your young child. For older kids, make it a routine to give a good night hug, along with a few minutes to talk, listen, or laugh together. Those extra few minutes with you can help your child feel calm, safe, and relaxed.

These may seem like small things — things you already do. But giving extra support and time keeps your child feeling loved and close to you. After a trauma, that closeness matters more than ever.",kidshealth.org
60,What Can Parents Do about Heavy Metals in Baby Food?,"

Larger text size Large text size Regular text size

I've heard about heavy metals in baby food. How can I keep my baby safe?

- Keeley

Heavy metals are found in soil, water, and the air we breathe. Plants take up these metals as they grow and can end up in the food we eat. Our bodies need some heavy metals (like iron and zinc) to work well, but other heavy metals (like arsenic and lead) are harmful. Some crops, like rice, absorb more of these harmful metals than others. Heavy metals can build up in the body over time and cause problems with learning, behavior, and attention.

When making baby food, companies add vitamins and minerals along with food additives that may contain heavy metals. Some baby foods have higher levels of heavy metals than others, including:

infant rice cereal

infant rice puff snacks

teething biscuits and rice rusks

fruit juice

carrots and sweet potatoes

Even organic baby food can have heavy metals in it.

The amount of heavy metals is low in baby foods, but you can take steps to lower it even more. Here are ways to do that:",kidshealth.org

69,Platelet Tests,"What are platelet tests?

Platelets, also known as thrombocytes, are small blood cells that are essential for blood clotting. Clotting is the process that helps you stop bleeding after an injury. There are two types of platelet tests: a platelet count test and platelet function tests.

A platelet count test measures the number of platelets in your blood. A lower than normal platelet count is called thrombocytopenia. This condition can cause you to bleed too much after a cut or other injury that causes bleeding. A higher than normal platelet count is called thrombocytosis. This can make your blood clot more than you need it to. Blood clots can be dangerous because they can block blood flow.

Platelet function tests check your platelets' ability to form clots. Platelet function tests include:

Closure time. This test measures the time it takes for platelets in a blood sample to plug a small hole in a tiny tube. It helps screen for different platelet disorders.

This test measures the time it takes for platelets in a blood sample to plug a small hole in a tiny tube. It helps screen for different platelet disorders. Viscoelastometry. This test measures the strength of a blood clot as it forms. A blood clot has to be strong to stop bleeding.

70,How to Prepare for a Lab Test,"How do I prepare for a lab test?

A laboratory (lab) test is a procedure in which a health care provider takes a sample of your blood, urine, other body fluid, or body tissue to get information about your health. Lab tests are often used to help diagnose or screen for a specific disease or condition. Screening helps diagnose diseases before symptoms occur. Other tests are used to monitor a disease or see if treatment is effective. Lab tests may also be done to provide more general information about your organs and body systems.

For any type of lab test, you should prepare for it by:

Following all the instructions given to you by your health care provider

Telling your provider or lab professional if you didn't follow these instructions exactly. It's important to be honest. Even a minor change from the instructions can have a big effect on your results. For example, some medicines raise or lower blood sugar levels. Taking them too close to a blood sugar test could affect your results.

Telling your provider about any medicines, vitamins, or supplements that you are taking

Taking these steps can help ensure your results will be accurate and reliable.",medlineplus.gov
71,What You Need to Know About Blood Testing,"What happens during a blood test?

A health care provider will need to take a sample of your blood. This is also called a blood draw. When a blood draw is taken from a vein, it's known as venipuncture.

During venipuncture, a lab professional, known as a phlebotomist, will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.

Venipuncture is the most common way to do a blood test.

Other ways to do a blood test are:",medlineplus.gov
72,How to Cope with Medical Test Anxiety,"What is medical test anxiety?

Medical test anxiety is a fear of medical tests. Medical tests are procedures that are used to diagnose, screen for, or monitor various diseases and conditions. While many people sometimes feel nervous or uncomfortable about testing, it doesn't usually cause serious problems or symptoms.

Medical test anxiety can be serious. It can become a type of phobia. A phobia is an anxiety disorder that causes an intense, irrational fear of something that poses little or no actual danger. Phobias can also cause physical symptoms such as rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, and trembling.",medlineplus.gov
73,How to Prepare Your Child for a Lab Test,"What happens to my child during a lab test?

Common lab tests for children include blood tests, urine tests, swab tests, and throat cultures.

Blood tests are used to test for many different diseases and conditions. During a blood test, a sample will be taken from a vein in the arm, a fingertip, or a heel.

If done on a vein , a health care professional will take a sample, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial.

, a health care professional will take a sample, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. A fingertip blood test is done by pricking your child's fingertip.

test is done by pricking your child's fingertip. Heel stick tests are used for newborn screenings, a test given shortly after birth to almost every baby born in the United States. Newborn screenings are used to help diagnose a variety of serious health conditions. During a heel stick test, a health care provider will clean your baby's heel with alcohol and poke the heel with a small needle.

During a blood test, encourage your child to look at you, rather than at the person drawing the blood. You should also provide physical comfort and distraction.

Urine tests are done to check for different diseases and for infections of the urinary tract. During a urine test, your child will need to provide a urine sample in a special cup. Unless your child has an infection or a rash, a urine test is not painful. But it can be stressful. The following tips may help.

Talk to your child's provider to find out if a ""clean catch"" method will be needed. For a clean catch urine sample, your child will need to: Clean their genital area with a cleansing pad Start to urinate into the toilet Move the collection container under the urine stream Collect at least an ounce or two of urine into the container, which should have markings to indicate the amounts Finish urinating into the toilet

If a clean catch sample is needed, practice at home. Ask your child to let out a bit of urine in the toilet, stop the flow, and start again.

Encourage your child to drink water before the appointment, but not go to the bathroom. This may make it easier to urinate when it's time to collect the sample.

Turn on the tap. The sound of running water can help your child begin to urinate.

Swab tests help diagnose different types of respiratory infections. During a swab test, a health care provider will:

Gently insert a cotton-tipped swab inside your child's nostril. For some swab tests, a provider may need to insert the swab deeper, until the reaches the uppermost part of the nose and throat, known as the nasopharynx.

Rotate the swab and leave it in place for 10-15 seconds.

Remove the swab and insert into the other nostril.

Swab the second nostril using the same technique.

Swab tests may tickle the throat or cause your child to cough. A swab of the nasopharynx may be uncomfortable and cause a gag reflex when the swab touches the throat. Let your child know beforehand that gagging may happen, but it will be over quickly. It may also help to tell your child that the swab is similar to the cotton swabs you have at home.

Throat cultures are done to check for bacterial infections of the throat, including strep throat. During a throat culture:

Your child will be asked to tilt their head back and open their mouth as wide as possible.

Your child's provider will use a tongue depressor to hold down your child's tongue.

The provider will use a special swab to take a sample from the back of the throat and tonsils.

A throat swab isn't painful, but like some swab tests, it can cause gagging. Let your child know what to expect and that any discomfort shouldn't last very long.",medlineplus.gov
74,Catecholamine Tests,"What happens during a catecholamine test?

A catecholamine test may be done in urine or blood. Urine testing is done more often because catecholamine blood levels can change quickly and may also be affected by the stress of testing.

But blood testing can be useful in helping to diagnose a pheochromocytoma tumor. If you have this tumor, certain substances will be released into the bloodstream.

For a catecholamine urine test, your health care provider will ask you to collect all urine during a 24-hour period. This is called a 24-hour urine sample test. For 24-hour urine sample test, your health care provider or a laboratory professional will give you a container to collect your urine and instructions on how to collect and store your samples. Test instructions usually include the following steps:

Empty your bladder in the morning and flush that urine away. Record the time.

For the next 24 hours, save all your urine passed in the container provided.

Store your urine container in the refrigerator or a cooler with ice.

Return the sample container to your health provider's office or the laboratory as instructed.

During a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.",medlineplus.gov
75,Antibiotic Sensitivity Test,"What is an antibiotic sensitivity test?

Antibiotics are medicines used to fight bacterial infections. There are different types of antibiotics. Each type is only effective against certain bacteria. An antibiotic sensitivity test can help find out which antibiotic will be most effective in treating your infection.

The test can also be helpful in finding a treatment for antibiotic-resistant infections. Antibiotic resistance happens when standard antibiotics become less effective or ineffective against certain bacteria. Antibiotic resistance can turn once easily treatable diseases into serious, even life-threatening illnesses.

Other names: antibiotic susceptibility test, sensitivity testing, antimicrobial susceptibility test",medlineplus.gov
76,Xylose Testing,"What happens during a xylose test?

A xylose test involves getting samples from both blood and urine. You will be tested before and after you drink a solution that contains 8 ounces of water that is mixed with a small amount of xylose.

For the blood tests:

A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial.

Next, you will drink the xylose solution.

You will be asked to rest quietly.

Your provider will give you another blood test two hours later. For children, it may be one hour later.

For the urine tests, you will need to collect all the urine you produce for five hours after you have taken the xylose solution. Your health care provider will give you instructions on how to collect your urine during the five-hour period.",medlineplus.gov
77,Measuring Blood Pressure,"What do the results mean?

Your results, also known as a blood pressure reading, will contain two numbers. The top or first number is the systolic pressure. The bottom or second number is the diastolic pressure. High blood pressure readings are also labeled by categories, ranging from normal to crisis. Your reading may show your blood pressure is:

Blood Pressure Category Systolic Blood Pressure

Diastolic Blood Pressure Normal Less than 120 and Less than 80 High Blood Pressure (no other heart risk factors) 140 or higher or 90 or higher High Blood Pressure (with other heart risk factors, according to some providers) 130 or higher or 80 or higher Dangerously high blood pressure - seek medical care right away 180 or higher and 120 or higher

If you've been diagnosed with high blood pressure, your provider may recommend lifestyle changes and/or medicines to control your blood pressure. Your provider may also recommend that you regularly check your blood pressure at home with an automated blood pressure monitor. An at-home blood pressure monitor usually includes a blood pressure cuff and a digital device to record and display blood pressure readings.

Home monitoring is not a replacement for regular visits to your provider. But it can provide important information, such as whether treatment is working or your condition may have worsened. Also, home monitoring may make the test less stressful. Many people get nervous about getting their blood pressure taken at a provider's office. This is called ""white coat syndrome."" It can cause a temporary rise in blood pressure, making the results less accurate. For more information about home monitoring of blood pressure, talk to your provider.

79,FDA and CDC Lift Recommended Pause on Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) COVID-19 Vaccine Use Following Thorough Safety Review,"Following a thorough safety review, including two meetings of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have determined that the recommended pause regarding the use of the Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) COVID-19 Vaccine in the U.S. should be lifted and use of the vaccine should resume.

The pause was recommended after reports of six cases of a rare and severe type of blood clot in individuals following administration of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. During the pause, medical and scientific teams at the FDA and CDC examined available data to assess the risk of thrombosis involving the cerebral venous sinuses, or CVST (large blood vessels in the brain), and other sites in the body (including but not limited to the large blood vessels of the abdomen and the veins of the legs) along with thrombocytopenia, or low blood platelet counts. The teams at FDA and CDC also conducted extensive outreach to providers and clinicians to ensure they were made aware of the potential for these adverse events and could properly manage and recognize these events due to the unique treatment required for these blood clots and low platelets, also known as thrombosis-thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS).

The two agencies have determined the following:

Use of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine should be resumed in the United States.

The FDA and CDC have confidence that this vaccine is safe and effective in preventing COVID-19.

The FDA has determined that the available data show that the vaccine’s known and potential benefits outweigh its known and potential risks in individuals 18 years of age and older.

At this time, the available data suggest that the chance of TTS occurring is very low, but the FDA and CDC will remain vigilant in continuing to investigate this risk.

Health care providers administering the vaccine and vaccine recipients or caregivers should review the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers Administering Vaccine (Vaccination Providers) external icon and Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers external icon , which have been revised to include information about the risk of this syndrome, which has occurred in a very small number of people who have received the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine.

CDC’s independent Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices met today to discuss the latest data on TTS, hearing from the vaccine manufacturer Janssen and the COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Technical (VaST) Subgroup, as well as a risk benefit analysis. ACIP is committed to be vigilant and responsive to additional information that could impact the risk benefit analysis of any of these vaccines. Vaccine safety monitoring will continue and any new information about TTS will be brought to ACIP as needed.

“Safety is our top priority. This pause was an example of our extensive safety monitoring working as they were designed to work—identifying even these small number of cases. We’ve lifted the pause based on the FDA and CDC’s review of all available data and in consultation with medical experts and based on recommendations from the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. We have concluded that the known and potential benefits of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine outweigh its known and potential risks in individuals 18 years of age and older. We are confident that this vaccine continues to meet our standards for safety, effectiveness and quality. We recommend people with questions about which vaccine is right for them have those discussions with their health care provider,” said Janet Woodcock, M.D., Acting FDA Commissioner.

“Above all else, health and safety are at the forefront of our decisions,” said CDC Director Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky. “Our vaccine safety systems are working. We identified exceptionally rare events – out of millions of doses of the Janssen COVID-19 administered – and we paused to examine them more carefully. As we always do, we will continue to watch all signals closely as more Americans are vaccinated. I continue to be encouraged by the growing body of real-world evidence that the authorized COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective, and they protect people from disease, hospitalization, and death. I urge anyone with questions about the COVID-19 vaccines to speak with their healthcare provider or local public health department.”

Assessment of Available Data

Medical and scientific teams at the FDA and CDC reviewed several sources of information and data related to the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine to reach today’s decision.

Specifically, the agencies assessed reports submitted to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS),external icon reviewed the medical literature and considered the information from global regulatory partners about thrombosis with thrombocytopenia that have been reported following use of a similar, yet not identical, COVID-19 vaccine using a virus from the adenovirus family that has been modified to contain the gene for making a protein from SARS-CoV-2.

Update on Adverse Events

On April 13, the FDA and CDC announcedexternal icon that, out of more than 6.8 million doses administered, six reports of a rare and severe type of blood clot combined with low blood platelet levels occurring in people after receiving the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine had been reported to VAERS. In these cases, a type of blood clot called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) was seen in combination with low levels of blood platelets (thrombocytopenia).

Today, the agencies can confirm that a total of 15 cases of TTS have been reported to VAERS, including the original six reported cases. All of these cases occurred in women between the ages of 18 and 59, with a median age of 37 years. Reports indicated symptom onset between 6 and 15 days after vaccination.

Monitoring for Safety Will Continue

The surveillance systems that are in place to monitor the safety of COVID-19 vaccines authorized for emergency use are working, as demonstrated by both agencies’ quick work to identify and investigate these rare, but serious adverse events. The FDA and CDC will continue with these efforts to closely monitor the safety of these vaccines.

Reports of adverse events following vaccination can be made to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting Systemexternal icon.

133,What You Need to Know About Blood Testing,"What happens during a blood test?

A health care provider will need to take a sample of your blood. This is also called a blood draw. When a blood draw is taken from a vein, it's known as venipuncture.

During venipuncture, a lab professional, known as a phlebotomist, will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.

Venipuncture is the most common way to do a blood test.

Other ways to do a blood test are:",medlineplus.gov
134,Recommendation to Pause Use of Johnson & Johnson's Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine,"Since use of COVID-19 vaccines began in the United States, scientists and doctors have constantly and carefully reviewed all reports of vaccine side effects and adverse events. As of April 23, 2021, more than 8 million doses of the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine had been given in the United States. As of April 23, 2021, experts reviewing safety reports for this vaccine found 15 reports of women who got the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine and later developed thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). TTS is a serious condition that involves blood clots with low platelets.

These reports suggest an increased risk of TTS one to two weeks after vaccination with the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. As of April 23, 2021, the reports reviewed all occurred in women between 18 and 59 years old, with a median of 37 years. These reports represent a reporting rate of 7 such events per 1 million vaccinations among women 18 through 49 years old and a rate of 0.9 per 1 million vaccinations among women 50 years and older. For all women, this is a rare adverse event. For women 50 years and older and men of all ages, the adverse event is even more rare. Reports show that symptoms of this adverse event started between 6 and 15 days after vaccination.",www.cdc.gov
135,Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis (CVST),"Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis (CVST)

Facebook Twitter Linkedin Pinterest Print

What is cerebral venous sinus thrombosis? Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) occurs when a blood clot forms in the brain’s venous sinuses. This prevents blood from draining out of the brain. As a result, blood cells may break and leak blood into the brain tissues, forming a hemorrhage. This chain of events is part of a stroke that can occur in adults and children. It can occur even in newborns and babies in the womb. A stroke can damage the brain and central nervous system. A stroke is serious and requires immediate medical attention. This condition may also be called cerebral sinovenous thrombosis. What causes cerebral venous sinus thrombosis? CVST is a rare form of stroke. It affects about 5 people in 1 million each year. The risk for this kind of stroke in newborns is greatest during the first month. Overall, about 3 out of 300,000 children and teens up to age 18 will have a stroke.

What are the risk factors for cerebral venous sinus thrombosis? Children and adults have different risk factors for CVST. Risk factors for children and infants include: Problems with the way their blood forms clots

Sickle cell anemia

Chronic hemolytic anemia

Beta-thalassemia major

Heart disease — either congenital (you're born with it) or acquired (you develop it)

Iron deficiency

Certain infections

Dehydration

Head injury

For newborns, a mother who had certain infections or a history of infertility Risk factors for adults include: Pregnancy and the first few weeks after delivery

Problems with blood clotting; for example, antiphospholipid syndrome, protein C and S deficiency, antithrombin III deficiency, lupus anticoagulant, or factor V Leiden mutation

Cancer

Collagen vascular diseases like lupus, Wegener’s granulomatosis, and Behcet syndrome

Obesity

Low blood pressure in the brain (intracranial hypotension)

Inflammatory bowel disease like Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis What are the symptoms of cerebral venous thrombosis? Symptoms of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis may vary, depending on the location of the thrombus. Responding quickly to these symptoms makes it more possible to recover. These are the physical symptoms that may occur: Headache

Blurred vision

Fainting or loss of consciousness

Loss of control over movement in part of the body

Seizures

Coma How is cerebral venous sinus thrombosis diagnosed? People who have had any type of stroke recover best if they get treatment immediately. If you suspect a stroke based on the symptoms, have someone take you immediately to the emergency room, or call 911 to get help. Doctors typically take a medical history and do a physical exam. Family and friends can describe the symptoms they saw, especially if the person who had the stroke is unconscious. The final diagnosis, however, is usually made based on how the blood is flowing in the brain. Imaging tests show areas of blood flow. These tests may be used to diagnose venous sinus thrombosis: MRI scan

CT scan

Venography

Angiography

Ultrasound

High blood pressure readings are also labeled by categories, ranging from normal to crisis. Your reading may show your blood pressure is:

Blood Pressure Category Systolic Blood Pressure

Diastolic Blood Pressure Normal Less than 120 and Less than 80 High Blood Pressure (no other heart risk factors) 140 or higher or 90 or higher High Blood Pressure (with other heart risk factors, according to some providers) 130 or higher or 80 or higher Dangerously high blood pressure - seek medical care right away 180 or higher and 120 or higher

If you've been diagnosed with high blood pressure, your provider may recommend lifestyle changes and/or medicines to control your blood pressure. Your provider may also recommend that you regularly check your blood pressure at home with an automated blood pressure monitor. An at-home blood pressure monitor usually includes a blood pressure cuff and a digital device to record and display blood pressure readings.

140,Platelet Tests,"What are platelet tests?

Platelets, also known as thrombocytes, are small blood cells that are essential for blood clotting. Clotting is the process that helps you stop bleeding after an injury. There are two types of platelet tests: a platelet count test and platelet function tests.

A platelet count test measures the number of platelets in your blood. A lower than normal platelet count is called thrombocytopenia. This condition can cause you to bleed too much after a cut or other injury that causes bleeding. A higher than normal platelet count is called thrombocytosis. This can make your blood clot more than you need it to. Blood clots can be dangerous because they can block blood flow.

Platelet function tests check your platelets' ability to form clots. Platelet function tests include:

Closure time. This test measures the time it takes for platelets in a blood sample to plug a small hole in a tiny tube. It helps screen for different platelet disorders.

This test measures the time it takes for platelets in a blood sample to plug a small hole in a tiny tube. It helps screen for different platelet disorders. Viscoelastometry. This test measures the strength of a blood clot as it forms. A blood clot has to be strong to stop bleeding.

As of April 23, 2021, more than 8 million doses of the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine had been given in the United States. As of April 23, 2021, experts reviewing safety reports for this vaccine found 15 reports of women who got the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine and later developed thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). TTS is a serious condition that involves blood clots with low platelets.

These reports suggest an increased risk of TTS one to two weeks after vaccination with the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. As of April 23, 2021, the reports reviewed all occurred in women between 18 and 59 years old, with a median of 37 years. These reports represent a reporting rate of 7 such events per 1 million vaccinations among women 18 through 49 years old and a rate of 0.9 per 1 million vaccinations among women 50 years and older. For all women, this is a rare adverse event. For women 50 years and older and men of all ages, the adverse event is even more rare. Reports show that symptoms of this adverse event started between 6 and 15 days after vaccination.",www.cdc.gov

What is polio?

Polio, or poliomyelitis, is a disabling and life-threatening disease caused by the poliovirus. The virus can infect a person’s spinal cord, causing paralysis (can’t move parts of the body). Paralysis caused by poliovirus occurs when the virus replicates in and attacks the nervous system. The paralysis can be lifelong, and it can be deadly.

It most often sickens children younger than 5 years old.

What are the symptoms of polio infection?

Most people who get infected with poliovirus do not have any symptoms. Some people (25 people out of 100) will have flu-like symptoms. These symptoms usually last 2 to 5 days.

In rare cases, poliovirus infection can be very serious. About 1 out of 200 people will have weakness or paralysis in their arms, legs, or both. This paralysis or weakness can last a lifetime.

Is it serious?

The risk of lifelong paralysis is very serious. Even children who seem to fully recover can develop new muscle pain, weakness, or paralysis as adults, 15 to 40 years later.

About 2 to 10 children out of 100 who have paralysis from polio die because the virus affects the muscles that help them breathe.

How does polio spread?

Poliovirus is very contagious. It spreads through contact with:

the stool (poop) of an infected person.

droplets from a sneeze or cough of an infected person.

If you get stool or droplets from an infected person on your hands and you touch your mouth, you can get infected. Also, if your child puts objects, like toys, that have stool or droplets on them into their mouth, they can get infected.

An infected person may spread the virus to others immediately before and up to 2 weeks after symptoms appear.

The virus may live in an infected person’s stool for many weeks. He or she can contaminate food and water when they touch it with unwashed hands.

People who don’t have symptoms can still pass the virus to others and make them sick.

Do people still get polio in the United States?

No, thanks to a successful vaccination program, the United States has been polio-free for more than 30 years, but the disease still occurs in other parts of the world. It would only take one person with polio traveling from another country to bring polio back to the United States.",www.cdc.gov

What

A collaborative study conducted by scientists from the National Institutes of Health, Department of Defense (DOD), and multiple academic institutions has identified blood biomarkers that could help to predict which athletes need additional time to recover from a sports related concussion. This collaboration, known as the Concussion Assessment, Research, and Education (CARE) consortium, is supported, in part, by DOD and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).

In this study, conducted at several sites across the U.S., 127 male and female collegiate athletes who had sustained a sports-related concussion were tested at several time points: shortly after injury, when their symptoms resolved, and one week after returning to play. Each athlete had also undergone preseason, baseline testing.

Using an ultrasensitive assay that can detect minute amounts of protein, the researchers tested blood serum from these athletes and identified two blood proteins that were associated with the length of time needed by the athletes to return to play. Amounts of these two proteins, tau protein and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were found to be significantly different in athletes who needed less or more than 14 days to return. While further research is needed, the results of this study are an important step towards the development of a test that could help predict which athletes need more time to recover from a concussion and resume activity.

This study was published in JAMA Network Open.

149,"Blood-based Biomarker Can Detect, Predict Severity of Traumatic Brain Injury","Blood-based biomarker can detect, predict severity of traumatic brain injury

NIH Clinical Center

A study from the National Institutes of Health confirms that neurofilament light chain as a blood biomarker can detect brain injury and predict recovery in multiple groups, including professional hockey players with acute or chronic concussions and clinic-based patients with mild, moderate, or severe traumatic brain injury. The research was conducted by scientists at the NIH Clinical Center, Bethesda, Maryland, and published in the July 8, 2020, online issue of Neurology.

After a traumatic brain injury, neurofilament light chain breaks away from neurons in the brain and collects in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The scientists confirmed that neurofilament light chain also collects in the blood in levels that correlate closely with the levels in the CSF. They demonstrated that neurofilament light chain in the blood can detect brain injury and predict recovery across all stages of traumatic brain injury.

“Currently, there are no validated blood-based biomarkers to provide an objective diagnosis of mild traumatic brain injury or to predict recovery,” said Leighton Chan, M.D., M.P.H., chief of the Rehabilitation Medicine Department at the NIH Clinical Center. “Our study reinforces the need and a way forward for a non-invasive test of neurofilament light chain to aid in the diagnosis of patients and athletes whose brain injuries are often unrecognized, undiagnosed or underreported. “

The study examined multiple groups including professional hockey players in Sweden with sports-related concussions, hockey players without concussions, hockey players with persistent post-concussion symptoms, non-athlete controls, and clinic-based patients at the NIH Clinical Center who were healthy or with acute, subacute, and chronic mild traumatic brain injuries. The study showed that neurofilament light chain in the blood:

Correlated closely with CSF neurofilament light chain in hockey players with concussions and non-athlete healthy controls, suggesting that blood neurofilament light chain could be used instead of CSF neurofilament light chain.

Demonstrated strong diagnostic ability for sports-related concussions, where it could identify hockey players with concussions from hockey players without concussions and could identify clinic-based patients with mild, moderate, and severe traumatic brain injuries from each other and controls. This is significant as there is an unmet need for an easy and accessible blood biomarker to determine at the time of injury or in the chronic phase if a person has a concussion or signs of a traumatic brain injury.

Could distinguish with high accuracy hockey players who could return to play after 10 days from those who developed persistent post-concussion symptoms and eventually retired from the game. In the clinic-based cohort, patients with worse functional outcomes had higher blood neurofilament light chain levels. This is significant as there is an unmet need for a blood biomarker that can help clinicians to determine when athletes can safely return to play or when patients can return to work or resume daily activities.

In the clinic-based patients, the levels of blood neurofilament light chain at five years after a single mild, moderate, or severe traumatic brain injury were significantly increased compared to healthy controls. This suggests that even a single mild traumatic brain injury (without visible signs of structural damage on a standard clinical MRI) may cause long-term brain injury, and serum neurofilament light could be a sensitive biomarker to detect even that far out from initial injury.

“This study is the first to do a detailed assessment of serum neurofilament light chain and advanced brain imaging in multiple cohorts, brain injury severities, and time points after injury,” said the study’s lead author, Pashtun Shahim, M.D., Ph.D., NIH Clinical Center. “Our results suggest that serum neurofilament light chain may provide a valuable compliment to imaging by detecting underlying neuronal damage which may be responsible for the long-term symptoms experienced by a significant number of athletes with acute concussions, and patients with more severe brain injuries.”

The study was funded by the Intramural Research Program at NIH, the Department of Defense Center for Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine at the Uniformed Services University, and the Swedish Research Council.

Traumatic brain injury is a major leading cause of death and disability in the United States with more than 2.87 million emergency department visits, hospitalizations and deaths annually. While majority of all traumatic brain injuries are classified as mild (also known as a concussion), it remains difficult to diagnose this condition. There are a wide range of variable behavioral and observational tests to help determine a patient’s injuries but most of these tests rely on the patient to self-report signs and symptoms. Also, imaging has limitations with detecting micro-structural injuries in the brain.

Dr. Chandra Jackson on COVID-19 and Sleep

Video of Coping with COVID-19: Sleep and Health

Excerpts from a conversation between Dr. Marishka Brown at NIH and Dr. Chandra Jackson, an NIH expert on sleep.

Brown: From a sleep perspective, how is the COVID-19 pandemic affecting people?

Jackson: Before the pandemic, at least a third of Americans were not getting the recommended amount of at least seven hours of sleep per day. And before the coronavirus, millions of people suffered from sleep disorders like insomnia.

It’s likely that the stress many of us had before the pandemic has now increased. For instance, if people already felt isolated and depressed, it could be more difficult now to cope. Some may also feel greater financial strain, or job and housing insecurity.

Many new challenges have also emerged. One is being or knowing an essential worker on the front lines, whether a medical doctor, nurse, or a cashier at a grocery store. This can induce anxiety, which we know negatively affects sleep.

Also, our routines have been disrupted. Keeping track of time can be difficult. Other major challenges relate to not being able to cut off work at the end of the workday because you’re at home. Or trying to manage the house with children who are used to being at school and may be getting too much screen time.

All of these factors many of us have been dealing with can cause stress and strain. Those have been shown to negatively affect sleep. Additionally, simply staying in the house versus going outside can greatly lower your exposure to natural light. And lack of natural light can reduce biological signals that are important for sleep at night.

Brown: How does sleep impact the immune systemThe system that protects your body from invading viruses, bacteria, and other microscopic threats.?

Jackson: Good sleep helps support the immune system. Disrupted sleep can reduce circulating cytokines, which are a type of protein that helps protect against infection. This clearly has implications for being able to ward off infectious agents like coronavirus.

And if you’re actually sick for whatever reason, resting your body seems to help you recover faster. Lastly, chronic sleep deprivation has also been shown to make vaccines less effective, by reducing the body’s ability to respond.

Brown: Can you speak to the role of disparities and sleep, and its interplay with COVID-19?

Jackson: Unfavorable sleep is common in the general population to begin with. But individuals who are Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Native American, and even sexual and gender minorities have been shown to be disproportionately burdened by poor sleep. Social stress is generally believed to be the connection across these different but intersecting social identity groups.

In terms of sleep disorders, the most common are obstructive sleep apnea and insomnia. Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, and Asian populations suffer disproportionately from obstructive sleep apnea. A lot of these disparities appear to start early in life. For instance, Black compared to white children have been shown to have a four to six times higher prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing. This is attributed not to genetics, but to living in economically deprived communities with relevant environmental hazards.

So sleep disparities are clearly relevant to the pandemic. They likely contribute to disparities in conditions like diabetes and heart disease. And these are conditions that we know increase susceptibility to poor outcomes related to COVID-19.

Additionally, the mental stress from COVID that we’re all feeling is likely exacerbating existing sleep disparities, because disadvantaged groups are disproportionately affected by the virus for largely social reasons. For instance, racial/ethnic minority groups are more likely to have service-oriented, essential, frontline, and often risky, low wage jobs without worker protections like paid sick leave.

151,Dr. Kenneth Wright on Shift Work and Sleep,"Q&A

Dr. Kenneth Wright on Shift Work and Sleep

Kenneth P. Wright, Jr., PhD, Professor of Distinction, Director, Sleep and Chronobiology Laboratory, University of Colorado Boulder

Excerpts from our conversation with Dr. Kenneth Wright, Jr., an NIH-funded expert on sleep at the University of Colorado, Boulder.

NIHNiH: What is the circadian system? And why is it disrupted by shift work, such as working the night shift?

Wright: The circadian system is our biological clock. That biological clock controls the timing of a lot of our behaviors. These include when you choose to eat and when you choose to be active. For humans, our bodies are programmed to eat food during the daytime, not at nighttime, and be physically active during the daytime and not at nighttime.

For example, look at a hormone called melatonin. Our clock tells the body when to produce melatonin. And high levels of melatonin signal our biological night. Humans are not meant to be eating when melatonin levels are high.

So when we don’t get enough sleep, we are awake when melatonin levels are high. And if we eat during that time, that is associated with impairments in our blood sugar.

That’s one example, but the same goes for any system in our body. We can show that if you don’t get enough sleep, or if your circadian clock is disturbed, that system will be dysregulated in one way or another.

NIHNiH: What kinds of problems can disrupting your circadian clock cause?

Wright: Long-term disruption of circadian patterns can lead to weight gain, to obesity. It can lead to the development of depression or worsening of it. It can lead to type 2 diabetes, it can lead to heart disease and stroke. It can lead to cancer. And when I say lead to, I mean it’s going to impact a lot of those fundamental processes in the body that contribute to these disorders.

NIHNiH: What advice do you give to people who work the night shift or other shifts that could throw off their biological clocks?

Wright: Shift work is a challenge because it really goes against our fundamental biology. But there are specific tips that we can give to people who do shift work.

One of them is to try to maximize your 24-hour total sleep time. What I mean by that is, say after a night shift a worker goes home, is awake for a little bit, and then goes to sleep. They may sleep for five or six hours. And then they wake up, because the clock in their brain tells them it’s time to be awake, not because they got enough sleep.

So what we what recommend is you get that five or six hours. And then you take about a two-hour nap before you go back to work. That will get you closer to that seven or eight hours of recommended sleep.

There’s also a huge population of shift workers that we tend not to focus on. Those are the early morning shift workers, people who start work before 7 am. They’ve got to go to bed earlier than normal, which can induce insomnia. They can try things like taking melatonin to try to go to bed earlier, or exposure to bright lights to try to shift their clock earlier.

Waking up around the same time every day is also important even for shift workers, because it’s a strong signal for our circadian clock. The more irregular you are, if your wake times are bouncing around every day and on the weekends, that’s associated with a lot of health problems.",newsinhealth.nih.gov
152,Good Sleep for Good Health: Get the Rest You Need,"Good Sleep for Good Health

Get the Rest You Need

Sometimes, the pace of modern life barely gives you time to stop and rest. It can make getting a good night’s sleep on a regular basis seem like a dream.

But sleep is as important for good health as diet and exercise. Good sleep improves your brain performance, mood, and health.

Not getting enough quality sleep regularly raises the risk of many diseases and disorders. These range from heart disease and stroke to obesity and dementia.

There’s more to good sleep than just the hours spent in bed, says Dr. Marishka Brown, a sleep expert at NIH. “Healthy sleep encompasses three major things,” she explains. “One is how much sleep you get. Another is sleep quality—that you get uninterrupted and refreshing sleep. The last is a consistent sleep schedule.”

People who work the night shift or irregular schedules may find getting quality sleep extra challenging. And times of great stress—like the current pandemic—can disrupt our normal sleep routines. But there are many things you can do to improve your sleep.

Sleep for Repair

Why do we need to sleep? People often think that sleep is just “down time,” when a tired brain gets to rest, says Dr. Maiken Nedergaard, who studies sleep at the University of Rochester.

“But that’s wrong,” she says. While you sleep, your brain is working. For example, sleep helps prepare your brain to learn, remember, and create.

Nedergaard and her colleagues discovered that the brain has a drainage system that removes toxins during sleep.

“When we sleep, the brain totally changes function,” she explains. “It becomes almost like a kidney, removing waste from the system.”

Her team found in mice that the drainage system removes some of the proteins linked with Alzheimer’s disease. These toxins were removed twice as fast from the brain during sleep.

Everything from blood vessels to the immune systemThe system that protects your body from invading viruses, bacteria, and other microscopic threats. uses sleep as a time for repair, says Dr. Kenneth Wright, Jr., a sleep researcher at the University of Colorado.

“There are certain repair processes that occur in the body mostly, or most effectively, during sleep,” he explains. “If you don’t get enough sleep, those processes are going to be disturbed.”

Sleep Myths and Truths

How much sleep you need changes with age. Experts recommend school-age children get at least nine hours a night and teens get between eight and 10. Most adults need at least seven hours or more of sleep each night.

There are many misunderstandings about sleep. One is that adults need less sleep as they get older. This isn’t true. Older adults still need the same amount. But sleep quality can get worse as you age. Older adults are also more likely to take medications that interfere with sleep.

Another sleep myth is that you can “catch up” on your days off. Researchers are finding that this largely isn’t the case.

“If you have one bad night’s sleep and take a nap, or sleep longer the next night, that can benefit you,” says Wright. “But if you have a week’s worth of getting too little sleep, the weekend isn’t sufficient for you to catch up. That’s not a healthy behavior.”

In a recent study, Wright and his team looked at people with consistently deficient sleep. They compared them to sleep-deprived people who got to sleep in on the weekend.

Both groups of people gained weight with lack of sleep. Their bodies’ ability to control blood sugar levels also got worse. The weekend catch-up sleep didn’t help.

On the flip side, more sleep isn’t always better, says Brown. For adults, “if you’re sleeping more than nine hours a night and you still don’t feel refreshed, there may be some underlying medical issue,” she explains.

Sleep Disorders

Some people have conditions that prevent them from getting enough quality sleep, no matter how hard they try. These problems are called sleep disorders.

The most common sleep disorder is insomnia. “Insomnia is when you have repeated difficulty getting to sleep and/or staying asleep,” says Brown. This happens despite having the time to sleep and a proper sleep environment. It can make you feel tired or unrested during the day.

Insomnia can be short-term, where people struggle to sleep for a few weeks or months. “Quite a few more people have been experiencing this during the pandemic,” Brown says. Long-term insomnia lasts for three months or longer.

Sleep apnea is another common sleep disorder. In sleep apnea, the upper airway becomes blocked during sleep. This reduces or stops airflow, which wakes people up during the night. The condition can be dangerous. If untreated, it may lead to other health problems.

If you regularly have problems sleeping, talk with your health care provider. They may have you keep a sleep diary to track your sleep for several weeks. They can also run tests, including sleep studies. These look for sleep disorders.

Getting Better Sleep

If you’re having trouble sleeping, hearing how important it is may be frustrating. But simple things can improve your odds of a good night’s sleep. See the Wise Choices box for tips to sleep better every day.

Treatments are available for many common sleep disorders. Cognitive behavioral therapy can help many people with insomnia get better sleep. Medications can also help some people.

Many people with sleep apnea benefit from using a device called a CPAP machine. These machines keep the airway open so that you can breathe. Other treatments can include special mouthguards and lifestyle changes.

For everyone, “as best you can, try to make sleep a priority,” Brown says. “Sleep is not a throwaway thing—it’s a biological necessity.”",newsinhealth.nih.gov
153,Catecholamine Tests,"What happens during a catecholamine test?

A catecholamine test may be done in urine or blood. Urine testing is done more often because catecholamine blood levels can change quickly and may also be affected by the stress of testing.

But blood testing can be useful in helping to diagnose a pheochromocytoma tumor. If you have this tumor, certain substances will be released into the bloodstream.

For a catecholamine urine test, your health care provider will ask you to collect all urine during a 24-hour period. This is called a 24-hour urine sample test. For 24-hour urine sample test, your health care provider or a laboratory professional will give you a container to collect your urine and instructions on how to collect and store your samples. Test instructions usually include the following steps:

Empty your bladder in the morning and flush that urine away. Record the time.

For the next 24 hours, save all your urine passed in the container provided.

Store your urine container in the refrigerator or a cooler with ice.

Return the sample container to your health provider's office or the laboratory as instructed.

During a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.",medlineplus.gov

It most often sickens children younger than 5 years old.

What are the symptoms of polio infection?

Most people who get infected with poliovirus do not have any symptoms. Some people (25 people out of 100) will have flu-like symptoms. These symptoms usually last 2 to 5 days.

In rare cases, poliovirus infection can be very serious. About 1 out of 200 people will have weakness or paralysis in their arms, legs, or both. This paralysis or weakness can last a lifetime.

Is it serious?

The risk of lifelong paralysis is very serious. Even children who seem to fully recover can develop new muscle pain, weakness, or paralysis as adults, 15 to 40 years later.

About 2 to 10 children out of 100 who have paralysis from polio die because the virus affects the muscles that help them breathe.

How does polio spread?

Poliovirus is very contagious. It spreads through contact with:

the stool (poop) of an infected person.

droplets from a sneeze or cough of an infected person.

If you get stool or droplets from an infected person on your hands and you touch your mouth, you can get infected. Also, if your child puts objects, like toys, that have stool or droplets on them into their mouth, they can get infected.

An infected person may spread the virus to others immediately before and up to 2 weeks after symptoms appear.

The virus may live in an infected person’s stool for many weeks. He or she can contaminate food and water when they touch it with unwashed hands.

People who don’t have symptoms can still pass the virus to others and make them sick.

Do people still get polio in the United States?

No, thanks to a successful vaccination program, the United States has been polio-free for more than 30 years, but the disease still occurs in other parts of the world. It would only take one person with polio traveling from another country to bring polio back to the United States.",www.cdc.gov
155,Pediatric Obstructive Sleep Apnea,"Overview

Pediatric obstructive sleep apnea is a sleep disorder in which your child's breathing is partially or completely blocked repeatedly during sleep. The condition is due to narrowing or blockage of the upper airway during sleep.

There are differences between pediatric obstructive sleep apnea and adult sleep apnea. While adults usually have daytime sleepiness, children are more likely to have behavioral problems. The underlying cause in adults is often obesity, while in children the most common underlying condition is enlargement of the adenoids and tonsils.

Early diagnosis and treatment are important to prevent complications that can affect children's growth, cognitive development and behavior.

Symptoms

During sleep, signs and symptoms of pediatric sleep apnea might include:

Snoring

Pauses in breathing

Restless sleep

Snorting, coughing or choking

Mouth breathing

Nighttime sweating

Bed-wetting

Sleep terrors

Infants and young children with obstructive sleep apnea don't always snore. They might just have disturbed sleep.

During the day, children with sleep apnea might:

Perform poorly in school

Have difficulty paying attention

Have learning problems

Have behavioral problems

Have poor weight gain

Be hyperactive

When to see a doctor

Make an appointment with your child's doctor if your child consistently wakes up in the morning feeling tired and has behavioral problems.

Causes

Obesity is a common factor underlying obstructive sleep apnea in adults. But in children the most common condition leading to obstructive sleep apnea is enlarged tonsils and adenoids. However, obesity also plays a role in children. Other underlying factors can be craniofacial anomalies and neuromuscular disorders.

Risk factors

Besides obesity, other risk factors for pediatric sleep apnea include having:

Down syndrome

Abnormalities in the skull or face

Cerebral palsy

Sickle cell disease

Neuromuscular disease

History of low birth weight

Family history of obstructive sleep apnea

Complications

Pediatric obstructive sleep apnea can have serious complications, including:",www.mayoclinic.org
156,"Blood-based Biomarker Can Detect, Predict Severity of Traumatic Brain Injury","Blood-based biomarker can detect, predict severity of traumatic brain injury

NIH Clinical Center

A study from the National Institutes of Health confirms that neurofilament light chain as a blood biomarker can detect brain injury and predict recovery in multiple groups, including professional hockey players with acute or chronic concussions and clinic-based patients with mild, moderate, or severe traumatic brain injury. The research was conducted by scientists at the NIH Clinical Center, Bethesda, Maryland, and published in the July 8, 2020, online issue of Neurology.

After a traumatic brain injury, neurofilament light chain breaks away from neurons in the brain and collects in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The scientists confirmed that neurofilament light chain also collects in the blood in levels that correlate closely with the levels in the CSF. They demonstrated that neurofilament light chain in the blood can detect brain injury and predict recovery across all stages of traumatic brain injury.

“Currently, there are no validated blood-based biomarkers to provide an objective diagnosis of mild traumatic brain injury or to predict recovery,” said Leighton Chan, M.D., M.P.H., chief of the Rehabilitation Medicine Department at the NIH Clinical Center. “Our study reinforces the need and a way forward for a non-invasive test of neurofilament light chain to aid in the diagnosis of patients and athletes whose brain injuries are often unrecognized, undiagnosed or underreported. “

The study examined multiple groups including professional hockey players in Sweden with sports-related concussions, hockey players without concussions, hockey players with persistent post-concussion symptoms, non-athlete controls, and clinic-based patients at the NIH Clinical Center who were healthy or with acute, subacute, and chronic mild traumatic brain injuries. The study showed that neurofilament light chain in the blood:

Correlated closely with CSF neurofilament light chain in hockey players with concussions and non-athlete healthy controls, suggesting that blood neurofilament light chain could be used instead of CSF neurofilament light chain.

Demonstrated strong diagnostic ability for sports-related concussions, where it could identify hockey players with concussions from hockey players without concussions and could identify clinic-based patients with mild, moderate, and severe traumatic brain injuries from each other and controls. This is significant as there is an unmet need for an easy and accessible blood biomarker to determine at the time of injury or in the chronic phase if a person has a concussion or signs of a traumatic brain injury.

Could distinguish with high accuracy hockey players who could return to play after 10 days from those who developed persistent post-concussion symptoms and eventually retired from the game. In the clinic-based cohort, patients with worse functional outcomes had higher blood neurofilament light chain levels. This is significant as there is an unmet need for a blood biomarker that can help clinicians to determine when athletes can safely return to play or when patients can return to work or resume daily activities.

In the clinic-based patients, the levels of blood neurofilament light chain at five years after a single mild, moderate, or severe traumatic brain injury were significantly increased compared to healthy controls. This suggests that even a single mild traumatic brain injury (without visible signs of structural damage on a standard clinical MRI) may cause long-term brain injury, and serum neurofilament light could be a sensitive biomarker to detect even that far out from initial injury.

“This study is the first to do a detailed assessment of serum neurofilament light chain and advanced brain imaging in multiple cohorts, brain injury severities, and time points after injury,” said the study’s lead author, Pashtun Shahim, M.D., Ph.D., NIH Clinical Center. “Our results suggest that serum neurofilament light chain may provide a valuable compliment to imaging by detecting underlying neuronal damage which may be responsible for the long-term symptoms experienced by a significant number of athletes with acute concussions, and patients with more severe brain injuries.”

The study was funded by the Intramural Research Program at NIH, the Department of Defense Center for Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine at the Uniformed Services University, and the Swedish Research Council.

Traumatic brain injury is a major leading cause of death and disability in the United States with more than 2.87 million emergency department visits, hospitalizations and deaths annually. While majority of all traumatic brain injuries are classified as mild (also known as a concussion), it remains difficult to diagnose this condition. There are a wide range of variable behavioral and observational tests to help determine a patient’s injuries but most of these tests rely on the patient to self-report signs and symptoms. Also, imaging has limitations with detecting micro-structural injuries in the brain.

157,Study of Mosquito Protein Could Lead to Treatments Against Life Threatening Viruses,"Study of mosquito protein could lead to treatments against life-threatening viruses

NIAID

The mosquito protein AEG12 strongly inhibits the family of viruses that cause yellow fever, dengue, West Nile, and Zika and weakly inhibits coronaviruses, according to scientists at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and their collaborators. The researchers found that AEG12 works by destabilizing the viral envelope, breaking its protective covering. Although the protein does not affect viruses that do not have an envelope, such as those that cause pink eye and bladder infections, the findings could lead to therapeutics against viruses that affect millions of people around the world. The research was published online in PNAS.

Scientists at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), part of NIH, used X-ray crystallography to solve the structure of AEG12. Senior author Geoffrey Mueller, Ph.D., head of the NIEHS Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Group, said at the molecular level, AEG12 rips out the lipids, or the fat-like portions of the membrane that hold the virus together.

""It is as if AEG12 is hungry for the lipids that are in the virus membrane, so it gets rid of some of the lipids it has and exchanges them for the ones it really prefers,"" Mueller said. ""The protein has high affinity for viral lipids and steals them from the virus.""

As a result, Mueller says the AEG12 protein has great killing power over some viruses. While the researchers demonstrated that AEG12 was most effective against flaviviruses, the family of viruses to which Zika, West Nile, and others belong, it is possible AEG12 could be effective against SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. But, Mueller said it will take years of bioengineering to make AEG12 a viable therapy for COVID-19. Part of the problem is AEG12 also breaks opens red blood cells, so researchers will have to identify compounds that will make the protein target viruses only.

Alexander Foo, Ph.D., an NIEHS visiting fellow and lead author of the paper, explained that mosquitoes produce AEG12 when they take a blood meal or become infected with flaviviruses. Like humans, mosquitoes mount a vigorous immune response against these viruses, with AEG12 bursting their viral covering. But, at the beginning of the project, Foo and his colleagues knew little about the function of AEG12.

""The prospect of studying a new protein is exciting, yet daunting,"" Foo said. ""Thankfully, we had enough clues and access to a wide range of expertise at NIEHS to piece it together.""

Co-author and crystallography expert Lars Pedersen, Ph.D., is leader of the NIEHS Structure Function Group. He routinely uses information about a molecule’s physical makeup in his work and encourages more scientists to consider using this data in their studies. He said, ""Our research shows that understanding the structure of a protein can be important in figuring out what it does and how it could help treat disease.""

167,Pregnancy Check-Ups: Healthy Start for Mom and Baby,"Pregnancy Check-Ups

Healthy Start for Mom and Baby

Life is busy before a baby arrives. There are many things to do to prepare. One of the most important is to visit your health care provider regularly.

Check-ups before your baby is born are called prenatal visits. They help make sure you and your baby are healthy. Your health care provider will look for certain problems that can happen during pregnancy. Some issues are best treated early. Others can be prevented before they start.

“Prenatal care is fundamental for shaping the lives of women and their children,” says Dr. Monica Longo, an NIH expert on prenatal health. Longo cares for women with high-risk pregnancies. Such women have a higher chance of complications.

If you think you may be pregnant, schedule a visit with your provider. If you’re pregnant, you’ll need to start regular prenatal visits. Most women have check-ups about once a month in the beginning. Then, they go more often later in the pregnancy.

During a prenatal visit, your provider will ask about your health history. They will also perform a physical exam and weight check. They’ll let you know how much weight gain is healthy for your body and help track your progress.

You’ll also be asked to provide a urine sample. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common during pregnancy. UTIs and other infections increase the risk of having a preterm birth. This is when you give birth at 37 weeks or earlier.

“One of the primary purposes of prenatal care is actually prevention,” says Longo. “We screen women to find potential health problems before those issues can worsen.”

During certain stages of pregnancy, your provider will perform blood tests and imaging tests. These include ultrasound exams to look at the baby’s growth and development. Visits are also an opportunity to talk with your provider about how to give your baby a healthy start.

“During prenatal visits, we educ-ate and counsel moms about healthy habits, healthy food choices, and exercise,” Longo says. “We also address any concerns a new mom-to-be might have.”

Taking a prenatal vitamin is also key. Folic acid is included in most prenatal vitamins. It reduces the risk of severe birth defects that affect the developing brain and spine.

It’s important to stay away from things that could harm your baby. These include certain medications, smoking, and alcoholic drinks. Also, talk with your provider about any health conditions. Conditions like diabetes (a disease that causes high blood sugar) and high blood pressure need to be brought under control.

Some women choose to talk with their provider before becoming pregnant. This is called a preconception visit. It can help you plan for a safer pregnancy.

Early and regular care for you and your developing baby is important. Studies show that prenatal care reduces the risk of having a low-birth weight baby. Low birth weight can cause health problems. Even during the pandemic, it’s essential to keep up with regular prenatal care.

“Providers around the globe have adapted prenatal care to fit the current challenges,” says Longo. That means using telehealth for visits that don’t have to be done in person.

Health care providers are also seeing fewer patients and extending the time between them. This reduces possible exposure in waiting rooms.

“Providers are prepared for these difficult times,” says Longo. So it’s crucial that moms-to-be keep up with prenatal care.",newsinhealth.nih.gov

175,Vaccine Safety: MedlinePlus Health Topic,"Summary

What are vaccines?

Vaccines play an important role in keeping us healthy. They protect us from serious and sometimes deadly diseases. Vaccines are injections (shots), liquids, pills, or nasal sprays that you take to teach your body's immune system to recognize and defend against harmful germs. The germs could be viruses or bacteria.

Some types of vaccines contain germs that cause disease. But the germs have been killed or weakened enough that they won't make you sick. Some vaccines only contain a part of a germ. Other types of vaccines include instructions for your cells to make a protein of the germ.

These different vaccine types all spark an immune response, which helps your body fight off the germs. Your immune system will also remember the germ and attack it if that germ ever invades again. This protection against a certain disease is called immunity.

These diseases can be very serious. Because of this, getting immunity from a vaccine is safer than getting immunity by being sick with the disease. And for a few vaccines, getting vaccinated can actually give you a better immune response than getting the disease would.

Do vaccines cause side effects?

As with medicines, any vaccine can cause side effects. Most of the time the side effects are minor, such as a sore arm, fatigue, or mild fever. They usually go away within a few days. These common side effects are often a sign that your body is starting to build immunity against a disease.

Serious side effects from vaccines can happen, but they are very rare. These side effects could include a severe allergic reaction. Other possible side effects are different for each vaccine. Talk with your health care provider if you're concerned about your health after getting vaccinated.

Some people worry that childhood vaccines could cause autism spectrum disorder (ASD). But many scientific studies have looked at this and have found no link between vaccines and ASD.

How are vaccines tested for safety?

Every vaccine that is approved in the United States goes through extensive safety testing. It starts with testing and evaluation of the vaccine before it's approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This process can often take several years.

First, the vaccine is tested in labs. Based on those tests, the FDA decides whether to test the vaccine with people.

Testing with people is done through clinical trials. In these trials, the vaccines are tested on volunteers. Clinical trials usually start with 20 to 100 volunteers, but eventually include thousands of volunteers.

The clinical trials have three phases. The trials are looking for the answer to important questions such as Is the vaccine safe? What dose (amount) works best? How does the immune system react to it? How effective is it?

During the process, the FDA works closely with the company who makes the vaccine to evaluate the vaccine's safety and effectiveness. If the vaccine is found to be safe and effective, it will be approved and licensed by the FDA.

After a vaccine is licensed, experts may consider adding it to the recommended vaccine, or immunization, schedule. This schedule is from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It lists which vaccines are recommended for different groups of people. They list which age groups should get which vaccines, how many doses they need, and when they should get them.

Testing and monitoring continue after the vaccine is approved:

The company making the vaccines tests every batch of vaccines for quality and safety. The FDA reviews the results of these tests. It also inspects the factories where the vaccine is made. These checks help make sure the vaccines meet standards for quality and safety.

The FDA, CDC, and other federal agencies continue to monitor its safety, to watch for possible side effects. They have systems to track any safety issues with the vaccines.

These high safety standards and testing help to make sure that vaccines in the United States are safe. Vaccines help protect against serious, even deadly, diseases. They not only protect you, but also help to keep these diseases from spreading to others.",medlineplus.gov
176,Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS),"Important: If you are experiencing a medical emergency, seek immediate assistance from a healthcare provider or call 9-1-1. CDC and FDA do not provide individual medical treatment, advice, or diagnosis. If you need individual medical or health care advice, consult a qualified healthcare provider.",vaers.hhs.gov
177,FDA and CDC Lift Recommended Pause on Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) COVID-19 Vaccine Use Following Thorough Safety Review,"Following a thorough safety review, including two meetings of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have determined that the recommended pause regarding the use of the Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) COVID-19 Vaccine in the U.S. should be lifted and use of the vaccine should resume.

The pause was recommended after reports of six cases of a rare and severe type of blood clot in individuals following administration of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. During the pause, medical and scientific teams at the FDA and CDC examined available data to assess the risk of thrombosis involving the cerebral venous sinuses, or CVST (large blood vessels in the brain), and other sites in the body (including but not limited to the large blood vessels of the abdomen and the veins of the legs) along with thrombocytopenia, or low blood platelet counts. The teams at FDA and CDC also conducted extensive outreach to providers and clinicians to ensure they were made aware of the potential for these adverse events and could properly manage and recognize these events due to the unique treatment required for these blood clots and low platelets, also known as thrombosis-thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS).

The two agencies have determined the following:

Use of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine should be resumed in the United States.

The FDA and CDC have confidence that this vaccine is safe and effective in preventing COVID-19.

The FDA has determined that the available data show that the vaccine’s known and potential benefits outweigh its known and potential risks in individuals 18 years of age and older.

At this time, the available data suggest that the chance of TTS occurring is very low, but the FDA and CDC will remain vigilant in continuing to investigate this risk.

Health care providers administering the vaccine and vaccine recipients or caregivers should review the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers Administering Vaccine (Vaccination Providers) external icon and Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers external icon , which have been revised to include information about the risk of this syndrome, which has occurred in a very small number of people who have received the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine.

CDC’s independent Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices met today to discuss the latest data on TTS, hearing from the vaccine manufacturer Janssen and the COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Technical (VaST) Subgroup, as well as a risk benefit analysis. ACIP is committed to be vigilant and responsive to additional information that could impact the risk benefit analysis of any of these vaccines. Vaccine safety monitoring will continue and any new information about TTS will be brought to ACIP as needed.

“Safety is our top priority. This pause was an example of our extensive safety monitoring working as they were designed to work—identifying even these small number of cases. We’ve lifted the pause based on the FDA and CDC’s review of all available data and in consultation with medical experts and based on recommendations from the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. We have concluded that the known and potential benefits of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine outweigh its known and potential risks in individuals 18 years of age and older. We are confident that this vaccine continues to meet our standards for safety, effectiveness and quality. We recommend people with questions about which vaccine is right for them have those discussions with their health care provider,” said Janet Woodcock, M.D., Acting FDA Commissioner.

“Above all else, health and safety are at the forefront of our decisions,” said CDC Director Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky. “Our vaccine safety systems are working. We identified exceptionally rare events – out of millions of doses of the Janssen COVID-19 administered – and we paused to examine them more carefully. As we always do, we will continue to watch all signals closely as more Americans are vaccinated. I continue to be encouraged by the growing body of real-world evidence that the authorized COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective, and they protect people from disease, hospitalization, and death. I urge anyone with questions about the COVID-19 vaccines to speak with their healthcare provider or local public health department.”

Assessment of Available Data

Medical and scientific teams at the FDA and CDC reviewed several sources of information and data related to the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine to reach today’s decision.

Specifically, the agencies assessed reports submitted to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS),external icon reviewed the medical literature and considered the information from global regulatory partners about thrombosis with thrombocytopenia that have been reported following use of a similar, yet not identical, COVID-19 vaccine using a virus from the adenovirus family that has been modified to contain the gene for making a protein from SARS-CoV-2.

Update on Adverse Events

On April 13, the FDA and CDC announcedexternal icon that, out of more than 6.8 million doses administered, six reports of a rare and severe type of blood clot combined with low blood platelet levels occurring in people after receiving the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine had been reported to VAERS. In these cases, a type of blood clot called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) was seen in combination with low levels of blood platelets (thrombocytopenia).

Today, the agencies can confirm that a total of 15 cases of TTS have been reported to VAERS, including the original six reported cases. All of these cases occurred in women between the ages of 18 and 59, with a median age of 37 years. Reports indicated symptom onset between 6 and 15 days after vaccination.

Monitoring for Safety Will Continue

The surveillance systems that are in place to monitor the safety of COVID-19 vaccines authorized for emergency use are working, as demonstrated by both agencies’ quick work to identify and investigate these rare, but serious adverse events. The FDA and CDC will continue with these efforts to closely monitor the safety of these vaccines.

Reports of adverse events following vaccination can be made to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting Systemexternal icon.

178,Recommendation to Pause Use of Johnson & Johnson's Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine,"Since use of COVID-19 vaccines began in the United States, scientists and doctors have constantly and carefully reviewed all reports of vaccine side effects and adverse events. As of April 23, 2021, more than 8 million doses of the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine had been given in the United States. As of April 23, 2021, experts reviewing safety reports for this vaccine found 15 reports of women who got the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine and later developed thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). TTS is a serious condition that involves blood clots with low platelets.

These reports suggest an increased risk of TTS one to two weeks after vaccination with the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. As of April 23, 2021, the reports reviewed all occurred in women between 18 and 59 years old, with a median of 37 years. These reports represent a reporting rate of 7 such events per 1 million vaccinations among women 18 through 49 years old and a rate of 0.9 per 1 million vaccinations among women 50 years and older.

179,What Are mRNA Vaccines and How Do They Work?,"Vaccines help prepare the body to fight foreign invaders (pathogens such as bacteria or viruses), to prevent infection. All vaccines introduce into the body a harmless piece of a particular bacteria or virus, triggering an immune response. Most vaccines contain a weakened or killed bacteria or virus. However, scientists have developed a new type of vaccine that uses a molecule called messenger RNA (or mRNA for short) rather than part of an actual bacteria or virus. Messenger RNA is a type of RNA that is necessary for protein production. In cells, mRNA uses the information in genes to create a blueprint for making proteins. Once cells finish making a protein, they quickly break down the mRNA. mRNA from vaccines does not enter the nucleus and does not alter DNA.

mRNA vaccines work by introducing a piece of mRNA that corresponds to a viral protein, usually a small piece of a protein found on the virus’s outer membrane. (Individuals who get an mRNA vaccine are not exposed to the virus, nor can they become infected by it.) Using this mRNA blueprint, cells produce the viral protein. As part of a normal immune response, the immune system recognizes that the protein is foreign and produces specialized proteins called antibodies. Antibodies help protect the body against infection by recognizing individual viruses or other pathogens, attaching to them, and marking the pathogens for destruction. Once produced, antibodies remain in the body, even after the body has rid itself of the pathogen, so that the immune system can quickly respond if exposed again. If a person is exposed to a virus after receiving mRNA vaccination for it, antibodies can quickly recognize it, attach to it, and mark it for destruction before it can cause serious illness.

Like all vaccines in the United States, mRNA vaccines require authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before they can be used. Currently vaccines for COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, are the only authorized mRNA vaccines. These vaccines use mRNA that directs cells to produce copies of a protein on the outside of the coronavirus known as the “spike protein”. Researchers are studying how mRNA might be used to develop vaccines for additional infectious diseases.",medlineplus.gov

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized three COVID-19 vaccines for emergency use. The vaccines are:

Emergency use authorization (EUA) allows these vaccines to be distributed in the U.S. Learn more about EUAs for COVID-19 vaccines from the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER).

Who authorizes COVID-19 vaccines for emergency use?

The FDA is the authority that has regulatory oversight of the safety, effectiveness and quality of vaccines that are used in the U.S., including COVID-19 vaccines. FDA employees who are career scientists and doctors are the people who decided to authorize COVID-19 vaccines after they thoroughly analyzed and evaluated the data on COVID-19 vaccine safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality.

The FDA may issue an EUA when the agency’s scientific experts have determined that the known and potential benefits of the vaccine outweigh its known and potential risks. FDA employees are fathers, mothers, daughters, sons, sisters, brothers and more. They and their families are directly impacted by the work they do.

Why should I get a COVID-19 vaccine?

When you get a COVID-19 vaccine, you are choosing to protect yourself and make a difference for your children, parents, grandparents, and other loved ones. Millions of people in the U.S. have already received a COVID-19 vaccine. For a community to be fully protected, most community members need to get the vaccine. Getting vaccinated to prevent COVID-19 will help protect you from COVID-19, and it may also protect the people around you.

How do I get a COVID-19 vaccine?

Go to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website to find your state and local health departments who are responsible for COVID-19 vaccine distribution. All questions and concerns should be sent to your state government or local health department. The U.S. government’s goal is to have enough COVID-19 vaccine doses for all people in the U.S. who choose to be vaccinated.

FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines are being distributed for free by states and local communities. If you see vaccines for sale online, or if someone asks you for money to get a vaccine appointment, to put your name on a waiting list, or to get access to a vaccine, it is a scam. You do not need to pay to get a vaccine appointment or to be put on a waiting list.

Do the COVID-19 vaccines work?

Yes. All three FDA-authorized vaccines are effective in preventing COVID-19 and related serious outcomes, including hospitalization and deaths. The FDA thoroughly evaluated and analyzed the safety and effectiveness data for all of the authorized COVID-19 vaccines and determined that the available data for each vaccine provides clear evidence that the known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks of each vaccine.

Do the COVID-19 vaccines work against the new variants?

The available information suggests that the authorized vaccines remain effective in protecting the American public against currently circulating strains of COVID-19. We are already talking with vaccine manufacturers about these new strains and how to quickly and safely make any changes that may be needed in the future.

Some variants spread more easily than others and are more transmissible than the original virus that causes COVID-19. To help slow the spread of COVID-19, get a COVID-19 vaccine when it is available to you. Other ways to slow the spread include:

Wearing a mask

Keeping 6 feet apart from others who don’t live with you

Avoiding crowds and poorly ventilated indoor spaces

Washing your hands often with soap and water (use hand sanitizer if soap and water aren’t available)

How safe are the COVID-19 vaccines?

The FDA evaluated data from clinical studies that included tens of thousands of people for each COVID-19 vaccine. The FDA authorized the vaccines because the data from these studies clearly showed that the known and potential benefits of the FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines outweighed the known and potential risks.



Report vaccine side effects toll-free at 1-800-822-7967 or online to FDA/CDC Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).

Millions of doses of FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines have been given to people all around the country. Serious adverse events following vaccination are very rare. Allergic reactions, some of which are severe, and cases of anaphylaxis have occurred following administration of COVID-19 vaccines. Anaphylaxis is a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction that happens within seconds or minutes of exposure to an allergen. Because of this remote chance of severe allergic reaction or anaphylaxis, health care providers may ask you to stay at the place where you received your COVID-19 vaccine for monitoring for 15 to 30 minutes.

For one vaccine, the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine, there have been cases reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) of a type of blood clot called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) in combination with low levels of platelets in the blood (thrombocytopenia). CVST occurs when a blood clot forms in the brain's venous sinuses. This prevents blood from draining out of the brain. It is a type of rare stroke.

On April 13, 2021, the FDA and CDC recommended a pause in the use of this vaccine out of an abundance of caution while it further investigates these cases and to ensure that the health care provider community is aware of the potential for these adverse events and can plan for proper recognition and management due to the unique treatment required with this type of blood clot.

Can I see the safety and effectiveness data that support the Emergency Use Authorization of the COVID-19 vaccines?

The FDA is publicly sharing information about COVID-19 vaccines so you can see the evidence for yourself. The FDA’s analysis of clinical trial data, as well as demographic information about the clinical study volunteers, is available in the FDA Briefing Document for each vaccine. You can also view the advisory committee webcasts where outside experts discuss the data. The FDA’s reasoning for authorizing each vaccine is available in the FDA Decision Memorandum.

Does the FDA monitor COVID-19 vaccine safety after authorization?

Yes. The FDA and the CDC have several systems in place to continually monitor COVID-19 vaccine safety. These systems, called “passive surveillance” and “active surveillance” systems, rapidly detect and investigate potential safety problems. Systems such as the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and CDC’s text-based v-safe system, which receive reports of adverse events following vaccination, are examples of passive surveillance systems. The FDA‘s BEST Initiative is an example of an active surveillance system, which can rapidly analyze information occurring in millions of individuals recorded in large data systems to investigate any safety signals that are identified by VAERS or v-safe.

Why are the FDA and CDC recommending a pause in the use of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine?

The FDA and CDC are reviewing data involving six cases reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) of a low level of platelets in the blood in combination with a rare and severe type of blood clot called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) in individuals who had received the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. One individual died. All cases occurred in females ranging in age from 18 through 48 years. In some of the reported cases of CVST, blood clots also involved large veins in the abdomen. Out of an abundance of caution, the FDA and CDC are recommending a pause in the use of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine while the FDA and CDC, including through its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices investigate these reports of serious adverse events. This is important, in part, to help ensure that health care providers are aware of the potential for these adverse events and can plan for proper recognition and management due to the unique treatment required for CVST with low levels of platelets. The safety monitoring program that is in place to monitor COVID-19 vaccines is working, as we were able to detect the reports of these very rare, serious adverse events early and take action to assess them. The FDA and CDC will continue to fully investigate all reports to determine if a causal relationship exists.

If I received the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine, am I at risk for these adverse events?

If you received the vaccine a month or more ago, the risk of these events appears to be extremely low. In all six cases, the symptoms occurred 6 to 13 days after vaccination. You should contact your health care provider immediately if you are experiencing any of the following symptoms:

These symptoms are distinct from the commonly reported side effects that people may experience in the first few days following vaccination, which can include headache, fatigue, muscle aches and nausea. Most of these side effects are mild to moderate in severity and last 1-2 days.

shortness of breath

chest pain

leg swelling

persistent abdominal pain

neurological symptoms (including severe or persistent headaches or blurred vision)

a diffuse rash on the skin consisting of pinpoint like spots (petechiae)

What should health care providers look for in evaluating Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine recipients for these rare events?

Healthcare providers should be alert to the signs and symptoms of thromboembolism and/or thrombocytopenia in individuals vaccinated with Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. In the management of cases of thromboembolism with thrombocytopenia following Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine, heparin and its derivatives should be avoided, and health care providers should consider consulting a hematologist.

Pregnant people are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19

Although the overall risk of severe illness is low, pregnant people are at an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 when compared with non-pregnant people. Severe illness includes illness that requires hospitalization, intensive care, or a ventilator or special equipment to breathe, or illness that results in death. Additionally, pregnant people with COVID-19 might be at increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth, compared with pregnant women without COVID-19.

Limited data are available about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines for people who are pregnant

Based on how these vaccines work in the body, experts believe they are unlikely to pose a risk for people who are pregnant. However, there are currently limited data on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnant people.

Clinical trials that study the safety of COVID-19 vaccines and how well they work in pregnant people are underway or planned. Vaccine manufacturers are also collecting and reviewing data from people in the completed clinical trials who received vaccine and became pregnant.

Studies in animals receiving a Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, or J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine before or during pregnancy found no safety concerns in pregnant animals or their babies.

CDC and the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) have safety monitoring systems in place to gather information about COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy and will closely monitor that information. Early dataexternal icon from these systems are preliminary, but reassuring. These data did not identify any safety concerns for pregnant people who were vaccinated or for their babies. Most of the pregnancies reported in these systems are ongoing, so more follow-up data are needed for people vaccinated just before or early in pregnancy. We will continue to follow people vaccinated during all trimesters of pregnancy to understand effects on pregnancy and babies.

The Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines are mRNA vaccines that do not contain the live virus that causes COVID-19 and therefore, cannot give someone COVID-19. Additionally, mRNA vaccines do not interact with a person’s DNA or cause genetic changes because the mRNA does not enter the nucleus of the cell, which is where our DNA is kept. Learn more about how COVID-19 mRNA vaccines work.

The J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine is a viral vector vaccine, meaning it uses a modified version of a different virus (the vector) to deliver important instructions to our cells. Vaccines that use the same viral vector have been given to pregnant people in all trimesters of pregnancy, including in a large-scale Ebola vaccination trial. No adverse pregnancy-related outcomes, including adverse outcomes that affected the infant, were associated with vaccination in these trials.

191,Vaccine Safety: MedlinePlus Health Topic,"Summary

What are vaccines?

Vaccines play an important role in keeping us healthy. They protect us from serious and sometimes deadly diseases. Vaccines are injections (shots), liquids, pills, or nasal sprays that you take to teach your body's immune system to recognize and defend against harmful germs. The germs could be viruses or bacteria.

Some types of vaccines contain germs that cause disease. But the germs have been killed or weakened enough that they won't make you sick. Some vaccines only contain a part of a germ. Other types of vaccines include instructions for your cells to make a protein of the germ.

These different vaccine types all spark an immune response, which helps your body fight off the germs. Your immune system will also remember the germ and attack it if that germ ever invades again. This protection against a certain disease is called immunity.

These diseases can be very serious. Because of this, getting immunity from a vaccine is safer than getting immunity by being sick with the disease. And for a few vaccines, getting vaccinated can actually give you a better immune response than getting the disease would.

Do vaccines cause side effects?

As with medicines, any vaccine can cause side effects. Most of the time the side effects are minor, such as a sore arm, fatigue, or mild fever. They usually go away within a few days. These common side effects are often a sign that your body is starting to build immunity against a disease.

Serious side effects from vaccines can happen, but they are very rare. These side effects could include a severe allergic reaction. Other possible side effects are different for each vaccine. Talk with your health care provider if you're concerned about your health after getting vaccinated.

Some people worry that childhood vaccines could cause autism spectrum disorder (ASD). But many scientific studies have looked at this and have found no link between vaccines and ASD.

How are vaccines tested for safety?

Every vaccine that is approved in the United States goes through extensive safety testing. It starts with testing and evaluation of the vaccine before it's approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This process can often take several years.

First, the vaccine is tested in labs. Based on those tests, the FDA decides whether to test the vaccine with people.

Testing with people is done through clinical trials. In these trials, the vaccines are tested on volunteers. Clinical trials usually start with 20 to 100 volunteers, but eventually include thousands of volunteers.

The clinical trials have three phases. The trials are looking for the answer to important questions such as Is the vaccine safe? What dose (amount) works best? How does the immune system react to it? How effective is it?

During the process, the FDA works closely with the company who makes the vaccine to evaluate the vaccine's safety and effectiveness. If the vaccine is found to be safe and effective, it will be approved and licensed by the FDA.

After a vaccine is licensed, experts may consider adding it to the recommended vaccine, or immunization, schedule. This schedule is from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It lists which vaccines are recommended for different groups of people. They list which age groups should get which vaccines, how many doses they need, and when they should get them.

Testing and monitoring continue after the vaccine is approved:

The company making the vaccines tests every batch of vaccines for quality and safety. The FDA reviews the results of these tests. It also inspects the factories where the vaccine is made. These checks help make sure the vaccines meet standards for quality and safety.

The FDA, CDC, and other federal agencies continue to monitor its safety, to watch for possible side effects. They have systems to track any safety issues with the vaccines.

These high safety standards and testing help to make sure that vaccines in the United States are safe. Vaccines help protect against serious, even deadly, diseases. They not only protect you, but also help to keep these diseases from spreading to others.",medlineplus.gov

193,Vaccine (Shot) for Whooping Cough (Pertussis),"What are the symptoms of whooping cough?

Whooping cough usually starts with the following symptoms:

Runny nose

Mild cough

A pause in breathing in babies (apnea)

Children and babies may then begin to develop these more serious problems:

Coughing very hard, over and over. These coughing fits happen more at night.

Gasping for breath after a coughing fit. They may make a “whooping” sound. This sound is where the name “whooping cough” comes from. Babies may not cough or make this sound—they may gag, gasp, or stop breathing.

Difficulty breathing, eating, drinking, or sleeping.

Turning blue from lack of oxygen.

Vomiting after coughing fits.

Coughing fits can last for up to 10 weeks or more, and sometimes happen again the next time the child has a respiratory illness.

Is it serious?

Whooping cough is most dangerous for babies and young children. In fact, babies younger than 1 year old who have whooping cough may:

Need to be cared for in the hospital

Develop pneumonia (a serious lung infection)

Have seizures

Suffer brain damage

Women can get Tdap during pregnancy to pass whooping cough protection to their babies. This helps protect babies until they can start getting their own whooping cough shots. Learn more…

Whooping cough can even be deadly. About 7 in 10 deaths from whooping cough are among babies younger than 2 months old. These babies are too young to get whooping cough shots.

How does whooping cough spread?

Whooping cough spreads easily through the air when a person who has whooping cough breathes, coughs, or sneezes. Almost everyone who is not immune to whooping cough will get sick if exposed to it. A person can spread the disease from the very beginning of the sickness (when he has cold-like symptoms) and for at least 2 weeks after coughing starts.

Since symptoms can be mild for some people, your baby can catch whooping cough from adults, grandparents, or older brothers or sisters who don’t know they have the disease.

Do people still get whooping cough in the United States?

Before the whooping cough vaccines were recommended for all infants, about 8,000 people in the United States died each year from whooping cough. Today, because of the vaccine, this number has dropped to fewer than 20 per year.

But, cases of whooping cough have been increasing over the past several years, and outbreaks of whooping cough can occur.",www.cdc.gov

What vaccines protect against tetanus?

There are 2 vaccines that help protect children against tetanus: DTaP and Tdap. Both also protect against diphtheria and whooping cough. These shots do not offer lifetime protection. People need booster shots to keep up protection.

Tetanus shots are safe.

check circle solid icon The tetanus shots are safe and effective at preventing tetanus. Vaccines like any medicine, can have side effects. These are usually mild and go away on their own.

What are the symptoms of diphtheria?

Diphtheria starts with a sore throat, mild fever (101 degrees or less), and chills. Next, it can cause a thick coating in the back of the nose or throat. The coating may be white or grayish and makes it hard to breathe or swallow.

Is it serious?

Diphtheria can be very serious. In children younger than 5 years old, as many as 1 out of 5 children who get diphtheria dies. About 1 out of 10 people who get diphtheria dies.

The coating in the back of the nose or throat can get so thick that it blocks the airway, so the person can’t breathe.

The diphtheria toxin can affect the heart, causing an abnormal heart rhythms and even heart failure. It can also affect the nerves and lead to paralysis (unable to move parts of the body).

How does diphtheria spread?

Diphtheria spreads when an infected person coughs or sneezes. A person who does not receive treatment can spread the disease for about 2 weeks after infection.",www.cdc.gov

Español Português 中文 Tagalog Tiếng Việt 한국어

COVID-19. We’ve been living with it for what sometimes seems like forever. Given the number of deaths that have occurred from the disease, it’s perhaps not surprising that some consumers are looking at unconventional treatments, not approved or authorized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Though this is understandable, please beware. The FDA’s job is to carefully evaluate the scientific data on a drug to be sure that it is both safe and effective for a particular use, and then to decide whether or not to approve it. Using any treatment for COVID-19 that’s not approved or authorized by the FDA, unless part of a clinical trial, can cause serious harm.

There seems to be a growing interest in a drug called ivermectin to treat humans with COVID-19. Ivermectin is often used in the U.S. to treat or prevent parasites in animals. The FDA has received multiple reports of patients who have required medical support and been hospitalized after self-medicating with ivermectin intended for horses.

Here’s What You Need to Know about Ivermectin

FDA has not approved ivermectin for use in treating or preventing COVID-19 in humans. Ivermectin tablets are approved at very specific doses for some parasitic worms, and there are topical (on the skin) formulations for head lice and skin conditions like rosacea. Ivermectin is not an anti-viral (a drug for treating viruses).

Taking large doses of this drug is dangerous and can cause serious harm.

If you have a prescription for ivermectin for an FDA-approved use, get it from a legitimate source and take it exactly as prescribed.

Never use medications intended for animals on yourself. Ivermectin preparations for animals are very different from those approved for humans.

What is Ivermectin and How is it Used?

Ivermectin tablets are approved by the FDA to treat people with intestinal strongyloidiasis and onchocerciasis, two conditions caused by parasitic worms. In addition, some topical (on the skin) forms of ivermectin are approved to treat external parasites like head lice and for skin conditions such as rosacea.

Some forms of ivermectin are used in animals to prevent heartworm disease and certain internal and external parasites. It’s important to note that these products are different from the ones for people, and safe when used as prescribed for animals, only.

When Can Taking Ivermectin Be Unsafe?

The FDA has not reviewed data to support use of ivermectin in COVID-19 patients to treat or to prevent COVID-19; however, some initial research is underway. Taking a drug for an unapproved use can be very dangerous. This is true of ivermectin, too.

There’s a lot of misinformation around, and you may have heard that it’s okay to take large doses of ivermectin. That is wrong.

Even the levels of ivermectin for approved uses can interact with other medications, like blood-thinners. You can also overdose on ivermectin, which can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hypotension (low blood pressure), allergic reactions (itching and hives), dizziness, ataxia (problems with balance), seizures, coma and even death.

Ivermectin Products for Animals Are Different from Ivermectin Products for People

For one thing, animal drugs are often highly concentrated because they are used for large animals like horses and cows, which can weigh a lot more than we do—a ton or more. Such high doses can be highly toxic in humans.

Moreover, FDA reviews drugs not just for safety and effectiveness of the active ingredients, but also for the inactive ingredients. Many inactive ingredients found in animal products aren’t evaluated for use in people. Or they are included in much greater quantity than those used in people. In some cases, we don’t know how those inactive ingredients will affect how ivermectin is absorbed in the human body.

Meanwhile, effective ways to limit the spread of COVID-19 continue to be to wear your mask, stay at least 6 feet from others who don’t live with you, wash hands frequently, and avoid crowds.

207,Antibodies Protect Against COVID-19 Reinfection,"Health Capsule

Antibodies Protect Against COVID-19 Reinfection

NIAID

After having COVID-19, most people’s bodies develop antibodies to help fight it off. These are special molecules made by the body’s disease defense system, the immune system. A study found that people with these antibodies were less likely to get COVID-19 again.

Researchers looked at more than 3 million people who had an antibody test for SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes COVID-19.

They found that about 11% of people had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. More than 88% had a negative test. And less than 1% of tests were inconclusive.

The scientists looked at who came down with COVID-19 after the test. They analyzed up to 30 days, 31–60 days, 61–90 days, and more than 90 days after.

About 3% to 4% of people with negative antibody tests got COVID-19 in each time period. But those who had antibodies were less likely to have COVID-19 as time went on. Only 0.3% of the people with antibodies had a positive COVID-19 test more than 90 days after. Those without antibodies were 10 times more likely to get the disease.

The findings suggest that people who have a positive result from an antibody test may be at lower risk for future infection with SARS-CoV-2.

NIH’s Dr. Lynn Penberthy, who led the research team, explains that more questions still need to be answered. “We are nevertheless encouraged by this early finding,” she says.",newsinhealth.nih.gov

209,Coronavirus and the Nervous System,"What is COVID-19?

Coronaviruses are common causes of usually mild to moderate upper respiratory tract illnesses like the common cold, with symptoms that may include runny nose, fever, sore throat, cough, or a general feeling of being ill. However, a new coronavirus called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged and spread to cause the COVID-19 pandemic.

COVID-19, which means Coronavirus disease 2019, is an infectious disease that can affect people of all ages in many ways. It is most dangerous when the virus spreads from the upper respiratory tract into the lungs to cause viral pneumonia and lung damage leading to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). When severe, this impairs the body’s ability to maintain critical levels of oxygen in the blood stream—which can cause multiple body systems to fail and can be fatal.

What do we know about the effects of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 on the nervous system?

Much of the research to date has focused on the acute infection and saving lives. These strategies have included preventing infection with vaccines, treating COVID-19 symptoms with medicines or antibodies, and reducing complications in infected individuals.

Research shows the many neurological symptoms of COVID-19 are likely a result of the body’s widespread immune response to infection rather than the virus directly infecting the brain or nervous system. In some people, the SARS-CoV-2 infection causes an overreactive response of the immune system which can also damage body systems. Changes in the immune system have been seen in studies of the cerebrospinal fluid, which bathes the brain, in people who have been infected by SARS-CoV-2. This includes the presence of antibodies—proteins made by the immune system to fight the virus—that may also react with the nervous system. Although still under intense investigation, there is no evidence of widespread viral infection in the brain. Scientists are still learning how the virus affects the brain and other organs in the long-term. Research is just beginning to focus on the role of autoimmune reactions and other changes that cause the set of symptoms that some people experience after their initial recovery. It is unknown if injury to the nervous system or other body organs cause lingering effects that will resolve over time, or whether COVID-19 infection sets up a more persistent or even chronic disorder.

top

What are the immediate (acute) effects of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 on the brain?

Most people infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus will have no or mild to moderate symptoms associated with the brain or nervous system. However, most hospitalized patients do have symptoms related to the brain or nervous system, most commonly including muscle aches, headaches, dizziness, and altered taste and smell. Some people with COVID-19 either initially have, or develop in the hospital, a dramatic state of confusion called delirium. Although rare, COVID-19 can cause seizures or major strokes. Muscular weakness, nerve injury, and pain syndromes are common in people who require intensive care during infections. There are also very rare reports of conditions that develop after SARS-CoV-2 infection, as they sometimes do with other types of infections. These disorders of inflammation in the nervous system include Guillain-Barré syndrome (which affects nerves), transverse myelitis (which affects the spinal cord), and acute necrotizing leukoencephalopathy (which affects the brain).

Bleeding in the brain, weakened blood vessels, and blood clots in acute infection

The SARS-CoV-2 virus attaches to a specific molecule (called a receptor) on the surface of cells in the body. This molecule is concentrated in the lung cells but is also present on certain cells that line blood vessels in the body. The infection causes some arteries and veins – including those in the brain – to become thin, weaken, and leak. Breaks in small blood vessels have caused bleeding in the brain (so-called microbleeds) in some people with COVID-19 infection. Studies in people who have died due to COVID-19 infection show leaky blood vessels in different areas of the brain that allow water and a host of other molecules as well as blood cells that are normally excluded from the brain to move from the blood stream into the brain. This leak, as well as the resulting inflammation around blood vessels, can cause multiple small areas of damage. COVID-19 also causes blood cells to clump and form clots in arteries and veins throughout the body. These blockages reduce or block the flow of blood, oxygen, and nutrients that cells need to function and can lead to a stroke or heart attack.

A stroke is a sudden interruption of continuous blood flow to the brain. A stroke occurs either when a blood vessel in the brain becomes blocked or narrowed or when a blood vessel bursts and spills blood into the brain. Strokes can damage brain cells and cause permanent disability. The blood clots and vascular (relating to the veins, capillaries, and arteries in the body) damage from COVID-19 can cause strokes even in young healthy adults who do not have the common risk factors for stroke.

COVID-19 can cause blood clots in other parts of the body, too. A blood clot in or near the heart can cause a heart attack. A heart attack or Inflammation in the heart, called myocarditis, can cause heart failure, and reduce the flow of blood to other parts of the body. A blood clot in the lungs can impair breathing and cause pain. Blood clots also can damage the kidneys and other organs.

Low levels of oxygen in the body (called hypoxia) can permanently damage the brain and other vital organs in the body. Some hospitalized individuals require artificial ventilation on respirators. To avoid chest movements that oppose use of the ventilator it may be necessary to temporarily “paralyze” the patient and use anesthetic drugs to put the individual to sleep. Some individuals with severe hypoxia require artificial means of bringing oxygen into their blood stream, a technique called extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Hypoxia combined with these intensive care unit measure generally cause cognitive disorders that show slow recovery.

Diagnostic imaging of some people who have had COVID-19 show changes in the brain’s white matter that contains the long nerve fibers, or “wires,” over which information flows from one brain region to another. These changes may be due to a lack of oxygen in the brain, the inflammatory immune system response to the virus, injury to blood vessels, or leaky blood vessels. This “diffuse white matter disease” might contribute to cognitive difficulties in people with COVID-19. Diffuse white matter disease is not uncommon in individuals requiring intensive hospital care but it not clear if it also occurs in those with mild to moderate severity of COVID-19 illness.

top

What is the typical recovery from COVID-19?

Fortunately, people who have mild to moderate symptoms typically recover in a few days or weeks. However, some people who have had only mild or moderate symptoms of COVID-19 continue to experience dysfunction of body systems—particularly in the lungs but also possibly affecting the liver, kidneys, heart, skin, and brain and nervous system—months after their infection. In rare cases, some individuals may develop new symptoms (called sequelae) that stem from but were not present at the time of initial infection. People who require intensive care for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, regardless of the cause, usually have a long period of recovery. Individuals with long-term effects, whether following mild or more severe COVID-19, have in some cases self-identified as having “long COVID” or “long haul COVID.” These long-term symptoms are included in the scientific term, P ost A cute S equelae of SARS- C oV-2 Infection (PASC).

top

What are possible long-term neurological complications of COVID-19?

Researchers are following some known acute effects of the virus to determine their relationship to the post-acute complications of COVID-19 infection. These post-acute effects usually include fatigue in combination with a series of other symptoms. These may include trouble with concentration and memory, sleep disorders, fluctuating heart rate and alternating sense of feeling hot or cold, cough, shortness of breath, problems with sleep, inability to exercise to previous normal levels, feeling sick for a day or two after exercising (post-exertional malaise), and pain in muscle, joints, and chest. It is not yet known how the infection leads to these persistent symptoms and why in some individuals and not others.

Nerve damage, including peripheral neuropathy

Some symptoms experienced by some people weeks to months after COVID infection suggest the peripheral nervous system, the vast communication network that sends signals between the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord) and all other parts of the body, is impaired. Peripheral nerves send many types of sensory information to the central nervous system (CNS), such as a message that the feet are cold. They also carry signals from the CNS to the rest of the body, including those that control voluntary movement. Nerve dysfunction is also a known complication in those with critical care illness such as the acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Symptoms of peripheral neuropathy vary depending on the type of nerves – motor, sensory, or autonomic – that are damaged.

Motor nerves control the movement of all muscles under conscious control, such as those used for walking, grasping things, or talking. Damage to the motor nerves can cause muscle weakness and cramps.

Sensory nerves carry messages from our sense of touch, sight, hearing, taste, and smell. Sensory nerves transmit information such as the feeling of a light touch, temperature, or pain. The symptoms of sensory nerve damage can include loss of sense of touch, temperature, and pain or a tingling sensation.

carry messages from our sense of touch, sight, hearing, taste, and smell. Sensory nerves transmit information such as the feeling of a light touch, temperature, or pain. The symptoms of sensory nerve damage can include loss of sense of touch, temperature, and pain or a tingling sensation. Autonomic nerves control organs to regulate activities that people do not control consciously, such as breathing, digestion, and heart and gland functions. Common symptoms include excess or absence of sweating, heat intolerance, and drop in blood pressure upon standing. Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (also known as POTS) can increase heart rate when standing up and cause such symptoms as lightheadedness (or fainting) or difficulty concentrating.

Fatigue and post-exertional malaise.

The most common persistent symptom weeks and months after COVID-19 infection is fatigue. The fatigue is similar to what one experiences with many viral infections such as the flu. The sense of fatigue can be brought on by both physical and mental activity. Some people are unable to return to work or school after COVID-19 due to fatigue, while others find it extremely difficult to accomplish their normal level of activity. Tasks such as walking the dog or going shopping can cause extreme tiredness and fatigue; some people can’t carry out everyday activities without feeling pain or tiredness. COVID-related complications such as depressed heart, lung, or kidney function, poor sleep, or muscle deconditioning are known to cause fatigue and affect the ability to exercise. Fatigue is very common in most inflammatory conditions. The cause(s) of fatigue in many of those suffering weeks and months after COVID-19 is not known.

Post-exertional malaise (PEM) is a condition in which otherwise usual activities are followed by a period of very severe fatigue and sense of feeling sick. PEM can occur with a delay after the activity, but can last for days thereafter.

Cognitive impairment/altered mental state

People with severe acute COVID-19 illness may develop confusion, delirium, and a depressed level of consciousness. Those suffering from post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 frequently have difficulty concentrating and memory problems, sometimes called “brain fog.” This impairment is a common symptom in those with severe fatigue of any cause. A variety of immune, metabolic, or blood vessel abnormalities or drug effects can contribute to the dramatic effects on cognitive function in the acute infection. Whether these also underlie the problems experienced weeks or months after mild or moderate illness is not known.

Muscle, joint, and chest pain

Some people continue to report pain in a muscle or group of muscles (myalgia), aching joints, and fatigue after recovering from the initial course of the virus. Persistent muscle pain and chest pain is commonly reported by persons recovering from ARDS, but is now being reported by those who had a mild or moderate infectious illness. Some individuals also have a sense of shortness of breath despite testing normal on pulmonary function tests.

Prolonged/lingering loss of smell (anosmia) or taste

Some people who have had COVID-19 may lose their sense of taste or smell, or the sensation of flavor. The loss of sense of taste or smell is characteristic of COVID-19 because the SARS-CoV-2 virus infects the tissue that forms the lining in the nose. The virus has been found to target certain cells in the nose that support the nerve cells. Those nerve cells detect odors and send that information to the brain. Damage to these supporting cells can cause smell or taste loss that can continue for weeks or months as these cells repair themselves or are replaced by new cells. During the recovery period some odors may smell different - even sometimes unpleasant or foul - than people remeber prior to being infected.

Persistent fevers and chills

Some people who recover from their acute (short-term) infection continue to have on-and-off fever, along with chills and body ache. Some people have a high, prolonged fever after the infection is gone, which might contribute to the sense of fatigue. In some instances, people who recover from the initial infection may have temperature dysregulation, in which it’s difficult for the body to keep a normal temperature.

Prolonged respiratory effects and lung damage

COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory disease that can seriously affect the lungs during and after the infection. Some people with the disease have breathing difficulties and some require supplemental oxygen support or mechanical ventilation via a respirator. The disease also can damage the muscles that help us breathe. Lung injury can cause low blood oxygen and brain hypoxia, which occurs when the brain isn’t getting enough oxygen. This can lead to cognitive impairment, seizures, stroke, and permanent damage to the brain and other organs. Results from several studies show that, even in people who have had mild-to-moderate infection, the effects of COVID-19 can persist in the lungs for months. Some people develop pneumonia after their acute illness has passed. Several people need pulmonary (lung) rehabilitation to rebuild their lung function. Studies show several people who had the infection, particularly those who had a more severe course of illness, also develop scarring of the lung and permanent lung dysfunction.

Headaches

Headaches are often among the many symptoms that can accompany infection from the coronavirus. Some people continue to have mild to serious headaches sometimes for weeks after recovery. The sensation of pressure is different from a migraine, which may be brought on by stress. The headaches may be infrequent or occur chronically (some people report having daily headache).

Sleep disturbances

Some people with long-term neurological effects from the SARS-CoV-2 infection report having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep (insomnia), excessive daytime sleepiness (hypersomnia), unrefreshing sleep, and changes in sleep patterns. It may be difficult for some people to wake up and fall asleep at their regular times. Depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can negatively affect sleep. Sleep disorders can contribute to fatigue and cognitive troubles. Some people report an increase in pain, headache, and stress because of lack of sleep. Continued loss of sleep also negatively affects attention and mood. For more information about COVID-19’s effect on sleep (as well as on the respiratory system) and tips to improve sleep, see the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.

Anxiety, depression, and stress post-COVID

The outbreak of COVID-19 is stressful for many people. People respond to stress in different ways and it is normal to experience a range of emotions, including fear, anxiety, and grief. Being isolated from others during the infection, the real risk of death, and the stress of hospitalization and critical care can trigger post-traumatic stress disorder. In addition, given the contagious nature of COVID-19, the individual is often not the only affected person in the family or circle of friends, some of whom may even have died. Some people may develop a mood or anxiety disorder. For information on post-COVID stress and coping, see the National Institute of Mental Health’s resources at National Institute of Mental Health's (NIMH) Director, Dr. Gordon In the News and NIMH Shareable Resources on Coping with COVID-19.

How do the long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection/COVID-19 relate to Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS)?

Some of the symptom clusters reported by people still suffering months after their COVID-19 infection overlap with symptoms described by individuals with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). People with a diagnosis of ME/CFS have wide-ranging and debilitating effects including fatigue, PEM, unrefreshing sleep, cognitive difficulties, postural orthostatic tachycardia, and joint and muscle pain. Unfortunately, many people with ME/CFS do not return to pre-disease levels of activity. The cause of ME/CFS is unknown but many people report its onset after an infectious-like illness. Rest, conserving energy, and pacing activities are important to feeling better but don’t cure the disease. Although the long-term symptoms of COVID-19 may share features with it, ME/CFS is defined by symptom-based criteria and there are no tests that confirm an ME/CFS diagnosis.

ME/CFS is not diagnosed until the key features, especially severe fatigue, post-exertional malaise, and unrefreshing sleep, are present for greater than six months. It is now becoming more apparent that following infection with SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19, some individuals may continue to exhibit these symptoms beyond six months and qualify for an ME/CFS diagnosis. It is unknown how many people will develop ME/CFS after SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is possible that many individuals with ME/CFS, and other disorders impacting the nervous system, may benefit greatly if research on the long-term effects of COVID-19 uncovers the cause of debilitating symptoms including intense fatigue, problems with memory and concentration, and pain.

Am I at a higher risk if I currently have a neurological disorder?

Much is still unknown about the coronavirus but people having one of several underlying medical conditions may have an increased risk of illness. However, not everyone with an underlying condition will be at risk of developing severe illness. People who have a neurological disorder may want to discuss their concerns with their doctors.

Because COVID-19 is a new virus, there is little information on the risk of getting the infection in people who have a neurological disorder. People with any of these conditions might be at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19:

Cerebrovascular disease

Stroke

Obesity

Dementia

Diabetes

High blood pressure

There is evidence that COVID-19 seems to disproportionately affect some racial and ethnic populations, perhaps because of higher rates of pre-existing conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and lung disease. Social determinants of health (such as access to health care, poverty, education, ability to remain socially distant, and where people live and work) also contribute to increased health risk and outcomes.

top

Can COVID-19 cause other neurological disorders?

In some people, response to the coronavirus has been shown to increase the risk of stroke, dementia, muscle and nerve damage, encephalitis, and vascular disorders. Some researchers think the unbalanced immune system caused by reacting to the coronavirus may lead to autoimmune diseases, but it's too early to tell.

Anecdotal reports of other diseases and conditions that may be triggered by the immune system response to COVID-19 include para-infectious conditions that occur within days to a few weeks after infection:

Multi-system infammatory syndrome - which causes inflammation in the body's blood vessels

Transverse myelitis - an inflammation of the spinal cord

Guillain-Barré sydrome (sometimes known as acute polyradiculoneuritis) - a rare neurological disorder which can range from brief weakness to nearly devastating paralysis, leaving the person unable to breathe independently

Dysautonomia - dysfunction of the autonomic nerve system, which is involved with functions such a breathing, heart rate, and temperature control

Acute disseminating encephalomyelitis (ADEM) - an attack on the protective myelin covering of nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord

Acute necrotizing hemorrhagic encephalopathy - a rare type of brain disease that causes lesions in certain parts of the brain and bleeding (hemorrhage) that can cause tissue death (necrosis)

Facial nerve palsies (lack of function of a facial nerve) such as Bell's Palsy

Parkinson's disease-like symptoms have been reported in a few individuals who had no family history or early signs of the disease

top

Does the COVID-19 vaccine cause neurological problems?

Almost everyone should get the COVID-19 vaccination. It will help protect you from getting COVID-19. The vaccines are safe and effective and cannot give you the disease. Most side effects of the vaccine may feel like flu and are temporary and go away within a day or two. In early vaccine development, there were extremely rare reports of unexplained neurological illness following COVID-19 vaccination, but regulators found no evidence the vaccines caused the illness. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) continues to investigate any report of adverse consequences of the vaccine and none have appeared as of yet. Consult your primary care doctor or specialist if you have concerns regarding any pre-existing known allergic or other severe reactions and vaccine safety. Scientists are studying the risk to benefit ratio of the vaccine in someone who previously developed Guillain Barré syndrome after a vaccination. The general sense is the COVID-19 vaccine is safe in individuals whose Guillain-Barré syndrome was not associated with a previous vaccination.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) site offers information on vaccine resources at https://www.coronavirus.gov/. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has information on vaccines for the coronavirus. See: https://covid19.nih.gov/.

210,Long-Term Effects of COVID-19,"Types of Post-COVID Conditions

Long COVID

Long COVID is a range of symptoms that can last weeks or months after first being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 or can appear weeks after infection. Long COVID can happen to anyone who has had COVID-19, even if the illness was mild, or they had no symptoms. People with long COVID report experiencing different combinations of the following symptoms:

Tiredness or fatigue

Difficulty thinking or concentrating (sometimes referred to as “brain fog”)

Headache

Loss of smell or taste

Dizziness on standing

Fast-beating or pounding heart (also known as heart palpitations)

Chest pain

Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath

Cough

Joint or muscle pain

Depression or anxiety

Fever

Symptoms that get worse after physical or mental activities

Multiorgan Effects of COVID-19

Multiorgan effects can affect most, if not all, body systems including heart, lung, kidney, skin, and brain functions. Multiorgan effects can also include conditions that occur after COVID-19, like multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) and autoimmune conditions. MIS is a condition where different body parts can become swollen. Autoimmune conditions happen when your immune system attacks healthy cells in your body by mistake, causing painful swelling in the affected parts of the body.

It is unknown how long multiorgan system effects might last and whether the effects could lead to chronic health conditions.

Effects of COVID-19 Treatment or Hospitalization

Post-COVID conditions also can include the longer-term effects of COVID-19 treatment or hospitalization. Some of these longer-term effects are similar to those related to hospitalization for other respiratory infections or other conditions.

Effects of COVID-19 treatment and hospitalization can also include post-intensive care syndrome (PICS), which refers to health effects that remain after a critical illness. These effects can include severe weakness and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD involves long-term reactions to a very stressful event.",www.cdc.gov

Dr. Ben Cowling on Super Spreading of COVID-19

Ben Cowling, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at the University of Hong Kong

Excerpts from our conversation with Dr. Ben Cowling, an NIH-funded epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong.

NIHNiH: What is “super spreading,” and how is it driving the COVID-19 pandemic?

Cowling: We looked at infections in Hong Kong. And what we found is that infections often occurred in clusters. So although on average, one person may have been infecting two others, actually, a lot of the cases didn’t infect anyone.

We found that 70% of cases didn’t affect anyone, didn’t transmit at all. And about 20% of cases were responsible for 80% of transmission. That’s called super-spreading.

NIHNiH: Has this pattern been seen before? Is it limited to Hong Kong?

Cowling: We observe that the minority of cases are responsible for a majority of transmission. It’s not the first time we've seen that happening. That happened for SARS (another coronavirus) in 2003. It happens for MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) coronavirus, as well. And now we think it happens for COVID.

Although our research is in Hong Kong, using Hong Kong data, actually the same kind of phenomenon has been reported elsewhere. And we believe it’s actually what’s happening a lot of the time with COVID in the U.S. as well.

NIHNiH: How does super spreading occur?

Cowling: You need to have a lot of people around a contagious case. If there’s a contagious person who isolates themselves once they worry they’re infected, there won’t be any superspreading because there won’t be an opportunity. You also need the case to be a relatively more contagious case. We’ve found that there’s a lot of variability in contagiousness.

One of the questions we still haven’t answered is: What makes a super-spreader? What is it about those people that makes them more contagious and more likely to transmit to lots of other people? We haven’t really identified it. Maybe there’s some genetic component. Maybe there’s some other factor related to age or social behavior.

NIHNiH: How can we reduce super spreading?

Cowling: If we can find ways to minimize the opportunity for super-spreading events, it would really help a lot. And so that means in the U.S., things like either making sure bars are closed or operating in reduced capacity or with better ventilation. Same for restaurants. Workplaces really need to think about not having a crowded cubicle area, where if there was one infected person in the middle that they could spread it to everyone. Public transport may need to be more careful, especially on public transport that has longer journeys.

NIHNiH: How will limiting super spreading help?

Cowling: If we can find ways to remove one of those ingredients for super-spreading events—and that’s the opportunity—then it can go a long way to reducing transmission. So that’s really, in my opinion, an important approach.

If we can reduce crowding, then we can actually do a lot of good without having to have drastic stay-at-home orders. We can still let people do some of the things they want to do.",newsinhealth.nih.gov

How Long Does Protection Last After COVID-19?

NIAID Integrated Research Facility, Fort Detrick, Maryland

After your body’s disease defense system (the immune system) fights off a virus, it keeps a memory of it. A study suggests that people’s immune systems remember COVID-19 for months after recovery.

The immune system makes different types of cells and molecules to fight disease. These include antibodies, T cells, and B cells.

Researchers looked at immune responses from about 200 people who’d recovered from COVID-19. Some had been infected up to eight months before the analysis. Other cases were more recent. Of the people who recovered, 95% had immune system “memories” of the virus that causes COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2.

Almost everyone had antibodies that block the virus’ spike protein. The virus uses this protein to enter cells. The number and type of antibodies varied between people. But the levels usually remained stable over time. They slightly decreased six to eight months after infection.

Immune cell levels also remained high. Memory B cells, which make antibodies, increased for a few months after infection and then remained stable. Most people had one important type of T cell. About half had another type of T cell that kills infected cells.

“Several months ago, our studies showed that natural infection induced a strong response, and this study now shows that the responses last,” says Dr. Daniela Weiskopf at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology. “We are hopeful that a similar pattern of responses lasting over time will also emerge for the vaccine-induced responses.”",newsinhealth.nih.gov
213,Understanding COVID-19: How To Protect Yourself During the Pandemic,"Understanding COVID-19

How To Protect Yourself During the Pandemic

COVID-19 has claimed millions of lives around the world. But we learn more about this disease every day. Scientists are developing tools that promise to slow and eventu­ally help us overcome the pandemic.

COVID-19 is caused by a new coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. There are many types of coronaviruses. Some cause the common cold. Others have led to fatal disease outbreaks. These include severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012, and now COVID-19.

Coronaviruses are named for the crown-like spikes on their surface. (Corona means crown.) The viruses use the spikes to help get inside your body’s cells. Once inside, they replicate, or make copies of themselves.

Scientists have learned how to turn these spikes against the virus through vaccines and treatments. They’ve also learned what you can do to protect yourself from the virus.

Protecting Yourself

You’re most likely to get COVID-19 through close contact with someone who’s infected. Coughing, sneezing, talking, and breathing produce small droplets of liquid. These are called respiratory droplets. They travel through the air and can be inhaled by someone else.

“COVID-19 is spread mainly through exposure to respiratory droplets that tend to drop within six feet,” says Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. That’s why it’s important to stay at least six feet (about two arm lengths) away from people who don’t live with you.

“Surfaces can be contaminated. But it is likely that this is a less common cause of infection rather than person-to-person directly,” Fauci says.

You can protect yourself and others by wearing a mask. Choose one that has at least two layers of fabric. Make sure that the mask covers your mouth and nose and doesn’t leak air around the edges.

“There’s very little transmission in places where masks are worn,” says Dr. Ben Cowling at the University of Hong Kong who studies how viruses spread. Cowling found that infections were most often spread in settings where masks aren’t worn.

“Masks work. But even with mandatory masking, you still need social distancing as well,” he says. You can lower your risk by avoiding crowds. Crowds increase the risk of coming in contact with someone who has COVID-19.

What to Look For

Common symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, headaches, fatigue, and muscle or body aches. People with COVID-19 may also lose their sense of smell or taste. Symptoms usually appear two to 14 days after being exposed to the virus.

But even people who don’t seem sick can still infect others. The CDC estimates that 50% of infections are spread by people with no symptoms. While some with this virus develop life-threatening illness, others have mild symptoms, and some never develop any.

Catching the virus is more dangerous for some groups of people. This includes older adults and people with certain medical conditions. These medical conditions include obesity, diabetes, heart and lung disease, and asthma. About 40% of Americans have at least one of these risk factors.

Getting Treatment

Better COVID-19 treatments mean that fewer people now get severely sick if they catch the virus. Scientists have been working to test available drugs against the virus. They’ve found at least two that can help people who are hospitalized with the virus.

A drug called remdesivir can reduce the time a patient spends in the hospital. A steroid called dexamethasone helps stop the immune systemThe system that protects your body from invading viruses, bacteria, and other microscopic threats. from reacting too strongly to the virus. That can damage body tissues and organs.

Antibody treatments are also available. Antibodies are proteins that your body makes to fight germs. Scientists have learned how to make them in the lab. Antibody treatments can block SARS-CoV-2 to prevent the illness from getting worse. They seem to have the most benefit when given early in the disease.

“Antibody treatments really do have the potential to help people, especially for treating individuals who are not yet hospitalized,” says Dr. Mark Heise, who studies the genetics of viruses at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Heise is working to develop mouse models to test treatments and vaccines.

Studies are now testing combinations of treatments. “Combining drugs that target both the virus and the person’s immune response may help treat COVID-19,” says Heise. Scientists are also looking for new drugs that better target the virus.

A Shot of Hope: Vaccines

It used to take a decade or more to develop a new vaccine. In this pandemic, scientists created COVID-19 vaccines in less than a year.

The first two vaccines approved for emergency use are from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech. Moderna’s vaccine was co-developed with NIH scientists. Both are a new type of vaccine called mRNA vaccines. mRNA carries the genetic information for your body to make proteins.

The vaccines direct the body’s cells to make a piece of the virus called the spike protein. These proteins can’t cause illness by themselves. But they teach your immune system to make antibodies against the protein. If you encounter the virus later, the antibodies provide protection against it.

The mRNA vaccines now available were shown to be more than 90% effective in large clinical trials. They can cause side effects—such as fatigue, muscle aches, joint pain, and headache. But both vaccines were found to be safe in the clinical trials.

“Get vaccinated. The vaccines are safe. They’re incredibly effective,” says Dr. Jason McLellan, an expert on coronaviruses at the University of Texas at Austin. McLellan’s research was critical in developing these vaccines. His team, along with NIH scientists, figured out how to lock the shape of the spike protein to make the most effective antibodies.

As the pandemic has gone on, new versions of the virus, or variants, have appeared. “We’re all very confident that vaccines will continue to work well against these variants,” McLellan says. “Vaccination also helps stop the development of new variants, because it provides fewer opportunities for the virus to change as it replicates.”

Many people will need to be vaccinated for the pandemic to end. Fauci estimates that 70% to 85% of the U.S. population will need to be vaccinated to get “herd immunity.” That’s the point where enough people are immune to the virus to prevent its spread. That’s important because it protects vulnerable people who can’t get vaccinated.

“It is my hope that all Americans will protect themselves by getting vaccinated when the vaccine becomes available to them,” Fauci says. “That is how our country will begin to heal and move forward.”",newsinhealth.nih.gov
214,Pediatric Obstructive Sleep Apnea,"Overview

Pediatric obstructive sleep apnea is a sleep disorder in which your child's breathing is partially or completely blocked repeatedly during sleep. The condition is due to narrowing or blockage of the upper airway during sleep.

There are differences between pediatric obstructive sleep apnea and adult sleep apnea. While adults usually have daytime sleepiness, children are more likely to have behavioral problems. The underlying cause in adults is often obesity, while in children the most common underlying condition is enlargement of the adenoids and tonsils.

Early diagnosis and treatment are important to prevent complications that can affect children's growth, cognitive development and behavior.

Symptoms

During sleep, signs and symptoms of pediatric sleep apnea might include:

Snoring

Pauses in breathing

Restless sleep

Snorting, coughing or choking

Mouth breathing

Nighttime sweating

Bed-wetting

Sleep terrors

Infants and young children with obstructive sleep apnea don't always snore. They might just have disturbed sleep.

During the day, children with sleep apnea might:

Perform poorly in school

Have difficulty paying attention

Have learning problems

Have behavioral problems

Have poor weight gain

Be hyperactive

When to see a doctor

Make an appointment with your child's doctor if your child consistently wakes up in the morning feeling tired and has behavioral problems.

Causes

Obesity is a common factor underlying obstructive sleep apnea in adults. But in children the most common condition leading to obstructive sleep apnea is enlarged tonsils and adenoids. However, obesity also plays a role in children. Other underlying factors can be craniofacial anomalies and neuromuscular disorders.

Risk factors

Besides obesity, other risk factors for pediatric sleep apnea include having:

Down syndrome

Abnormalities in the skull or face

Cerebral palsy

Sickle cell disease

Neuromuscular disease

History of low birth weight

Family history of obstructive sleep apnea

Complications

Pediatric obstructive sleep apnea can have serious complications, including:",www.mayoclinic.org
215,Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR TB),"Fact Sheet

(PDFpdf icon – 37k)

Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR TB)

What is tuberculosis (TB)?

Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease caused by bacteria that are spread from person to person through the air. TB usually affects the lungs, but it can also affect other parts of the body, such as the brain, the kidneys, or the spine. In most cases, TB is treatable and curable; however, persons with TB can die if they do not get proper treatment.

What is multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB)?

Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR TB) is caused by an organism that is resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampin, the two most potent TB drugs. These drugs are used to treat all persons with TB disease.

What is extensively drug resistant tuberculosis (XDR TB)?

Extensively drug resistant TB (XDR TB) is a rare type of MDR TB that is resistant to isoniazid and rifampin, plus any fluoroquinolone and at least one of three injectable second-line drugs (i.e., amikacin, kanamycin, or capreomycin).

Because XDR TB is resistant to the most potent TB drugs, patients are left with treatment options that are much less effective.

XDR TB is of special concern for persons with HIV infection or other conditions that can weaken the immune system. These persons are more likely to develop TB disease once they are infected, and also have a higher risk of death once they develop TB.

How is TB spread?

Drug-susceptible TB and drug-resistant TB are spread the same way. TB bacteria are put into the air when a person with TB disease of the lungs or throat coughs, sneezes, speaks, or sings. These bacteria can float in the air for several hours, depending on the environment. Persons who breathe in the air containing these TB bacteria can become infected.

TB is not spread by

Shaking someone’s hand

Sharing food or drink

Touching bed linens or toilet seats

Sharing toothbrushes

Kissing

How does drug resistance happen?

Resistance to anti-TB drugs can occur when these drugs are misused or mismanaged. Examples include when patients do not complete their full course of treatment; when health-care providers prescribe the wrong treatment, the wrong dose, or length of time for taking the drugs; when the supply of drugs is not always available; or when the drugs are of poor quality.

Who is at risk for getting MDR TB?

Drug resistance is more common in people who:

Do not take their TB medicine regularly

Do not take all of their TB medicine as told by their doctor or nurse

Develop TB disease again, after having taken TB medicine in the past

Come from areas of the world where drug-resistant TB is common

Have spent time with someone known to have drug-resistant TB disease

How can MDR TB be prevented?

The most important thing a person can do to prevent the spread of MDR TB is to take all of their medications exactly as prescribed by their health care provider. No doses should be missed and treatment should not be stopped early. Patients should tell their health care provider if they are having trouble taking the medications. If patients plan to travel, they should talk to their health care providers and make sure they have enough medicine to last while away.

Health care providers can help prevent MDR TB by quickly diagnosing cases, following recommended treatment guidelines, monitoring patients’ response to treatment, and making sure therapy is completed.

Another way to prevent getting MDR TB is to avoid exposure to known MDR TB patients in closed or crowded places such as hospitals, prisons, or homeless shelters. If you work in hospitals or health-care settings where TB patients are likely to be seen, you should consult infection control or occupational health experts. Ask about administrative and environmental procedures for preventing exposure to TB. Once those procedures are implemented, additional measures could include using personal respiratory protective devices.

Is there a vaccine to prevent TB?

Yes, there is a vaccine for TB disease called Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG). It is used in some countries to prevent severe forms of TB in children. However, BCG is not generally recommended in the United States because it has limited effectiveness for preventing TB overall.

What should I do if I think I have been exposed to someone with TB disease?

If you think you have been exposed to someone with TB disease, you should contact your doctor or local health department about getting a TB skin test or TB blood test. And tell the doctor or nurse when you spent time with this person.

What are the symptoms of TB disease?

The general symptoms of TB disease include feelings of sickness or weakness, weight loss, fever, and night sweats. The symptoms of TB disease of the lungs may also include coughing, chest pain, and coughing up blood. Symptoms of TB disease in other parts of the body depend on the area affected. If you have these symptoms, you should contact your doctor or local health department.

216,Allergens in Cosmetics,"Cosmetic products (such as soaps, lotions, face and eye make up, fragrances, etc.) can provoke allergic reactions in some people. Many people suffer from allergies and anyone at any age can develop allergies. Allergic reactions are the immune system’s overreaction to substances that may otherwise be harmless. An allergen can trigger the immune system to release chemical substances such as antibodies that result in allergy symptoms. Many people are familiar with seasonal allergies brought on by pollen from blooming plants, or with food allergies. Allergic reactions to cosmetics most often appear as itchy, red rashes on the skin – or contact dermatitis.

This page provides information about:

Common Allergens Found in Cosmetic Products

The FDA has compiled the list below of common allergens found in some cosmetic products. These are allergens that cause most allergic reactions from the use of cosmetic products.

Common allergens fall into the five classes as detailed below: natural rubber, fragrances, preservatives, dyes, and metals.

What Consumers Can Do

Regarding possible allergens in cosmetics, the best way to prevent an allergic reaction is to know what you are sensitive to and how to avoid it. One way to accomplish this is by carefully reading the product ingredient panel and avoiding ingredients you know or think you are allergic to. It isn’t enough to check for terms like “hypoallergenic”, “fragrance-free” or “for sensitive skin,” as there is no federal standard or definition that governs the use of these terms in the U.S. However, under the authority of the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (FPLA), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires an ingredient declaration on cosmetic products sold at the retail level to consumers. However, certain ingredients may be listed generally as “fragrance,” or “perfume,” without identifying the specific ingredients.

If you have reviewed the product ingredient panel and still have questions regarding the substances in the product, you may contact the manufacturer listed in the product label. In addition, consumers should always check product labels and follow the manufacturer instructions before applying as directed. Reading the label on products is especially important as some products contain ingredients that may cause irritation, regardless of whether you have allergies or not. For example, manufacturers of certain hair dyes instruct users to test a small amount of product first – to see if they have a sensitivity to the ingredients in the product before applying it more broadly.

Symptoms of Allergic Reactions

Allergic reactions can range in severity, but may include hives, itchy skin, a rash, flaking or peeling skin, facial swelling, irritation of the eyes, nose and mouth, wheezing, and anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction that can be life-threatening. Symptoms of anaphylaxis include a lack of consciousness, shortness of breath, trouble swallowing, lightheadedness, chest pain, a rapid, weak pulse, nausea, and vomiting. If anaphylaxis symptoms occur, seek medical attention immediately.

In addition to allergic contact dermatitis, fragrance ingredients may also affect the respiratory system because they are essentially vapor and can be inhaled. This is especially true in patients with asthma, allergic rhinitis, and viral respiratory infections. For people with sensitivities to certain fragrances, inhaling them may result in shortness of breath, the sensation of being suffocated, coughing, phlegm, a runny or stuffy nose, headache, chest tightness, and wheezing.

If you experience symptoms of what you suspect is an allergic reaction, consult your healthcare professional, as sensitivity to allergens can become more severe over time. Be sure to discuss with your healthcare provider what product or particular substance you think might be triggering the allergic reaction. They may recommend different types of tests to better understand what you are allergic to.

If you believe you have experienced an adverse event (allergic reaction or illness) after using a cosmetic product, you can also submit a report to the FDA. The FDA encourages consumers with questions about cosmetic products to submit inquiries.

Testing for Allergens

There is some good news. You don’t have to wait until you have an allergic reaction to try and figure out what you are allergic to. You can get tested. Knowing precisely what allergen has caused a reaction will help you to avoid further exposure to the substance. Your healthcare provider may recommend you undergo patch testing or some other, less frequently used tests.

Patch Test

This test is often used to diagnose dermatitis, or irritation and swelling of the skin. This test involves placing a small amount of allergen on the skin and covering it for 48 hours. A doctor will inspect the skin after 72 to 96 hours and check for signs of an allergic reaction, including, redness, a rash, or hives. Based on the symptoms present, the physician can determine whether the patient has had an allergic reaction. Patch testing requires two to three office visits.



If a patient has very sensitive skin, this type of testing may not be specific enough to help identify allergens and other methods may be used.

Other Testing Types Less Frequently Used: Prick Test

This type of testing involves placing an allergen on the patient’s skin and pricking the skin in that same spot with a needle. The areas that were pricked (usually on the forearms) are then monitored. Redness, itching, or swelling may develop if the person is allergic to the substance.

The areas that were pricked (usually on the forearms) are then monitored. Redness, itching, or swelling may develop if the person is allergic to the substance. Intradermal Test

This test is like the prick test; however, for this test, allergens are injected into the top layer of skin and monitored for any signs of allergic reaction; redness, swelling, itching, etc.

This test is like the prick test; however, for this test, allergens are injected into the top layer of skin and monitored for any signs of allergic reaction; redness, swelling, itching, etc. Allergy Blood Test

This test involves taking a blood sample from a patient and adding an allergen to it to see if antibodies are created. If antibodies are produced in response to the allergen, then the patient is likely allergic to that substance.

FDA Activities on Allergens in Cosmetics

To better understand allergens in cosmetics, the FDA focuses its efforts around three main areas:

Monitoring of adverse event reporting;

Conducting scientific research on the mechanisms of allergic reactions and how allergens interact with the body’s immune system; and

Conducting research on consumer practices, the frequency of adverse reactions, and consumer awareness of allergens in cosmetics.

Monitoring Adverse Event Reporting

Adverse event reports contain critical medical information and descriptions that help the FDA identify signals of potential safety issues with cosmetic products and ingredients. The FDA receives adverse event reports from healthcare professionals and consumers via MedWatch. The FDA reviews all adverse event reports and when necessary, takes action to address safety issues associated with cosmetic products and ingredients.

More information on adverse event reporting can be found at the How to Report a Cosmetic Related Complaint page.

Scientific Research on Cosmetic Allergens

The FDA is interested in better understanding how allergens interact with the body’s immune system. To do this, FDA scientists are collaborating with scientists at the National Center for Natural Products Research at the University of Mississippi and University of Florida. Through these partnerships we can better understand how allergic reactions are induced, and we are identifying new ingredients capable of inducing allergic reaction. We are working with our research partners to develop animal-free testing methods to identify potential allergens and are exploring whether allergen testing data can help us further identify potential allergenic ingredients in cosmetic products. We are also exploring the existing data for quality and potential gaps.

The FDA is also engaged in research specific to fragrance ingredients. The study’s purpose is to identify the likelihood of an adverse reaction from the use of products containing fragrance ingredients. This project will help establish acceptable levels for multiple fragrance ingredients used in a variety of rinse-off and leave-on cosmetic products. The methodology established in this project may be used in future studies to perform similar assessments for additional cosmetics ingredients.

Additional Information

Enhancing our scientific understanding of allergens however, is only one area of interest for the agency. The FDA is also taking steps to learn more about consumer practices and use of cosmetics. We are conducting consumer surveys and focus groups to collect the following information:

How consumers use cosmetics;

How often consumers experience an adverse reaction from the use of cosmetics with potential allergens;

How aware are consumers of the presence of allergens in cosmetics; and

What actions (if any) do consumers take to avoid allergens in cosmetics.

In addition, the FDA intends to conduct interviews with the cosmetics industry to understand how manufacturing, marketing, and sale of cosmetic products is impacted by information on allergic reactions to cosmetic products. Furthermore, from interviews with state and local regulatory authorities, the FDA hopes to learn about their awareness of safety issues associated with cosmetic ingredients, including potential allergens, and how they monitor and address these issues.

217,Formaldehyde in Hair Smoothing Products: What You Should Know,"Image

Español

If you decide that you want to make your hair less frizzy or straighter, you may choose to go to a professional stylist at a hair salon for a hair straightening or smoothing service. Most hair smoothing or straightening products release formaldehyde gas, a known human carcinogen as classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, into the air during the hair straightening or smoothing process. Formaldehyde exposure can cause both short- and long-term effects that may impact your health.

This page provides information about:

What Happens During the Hair Smoothing Process?

Your stylist usually applies a hair straightening or smoothing solution to your hair and follows it with a heat processing step—typically performed with a flat iron device that seals the solution into the strands of the hair. When the solution is heated, the formaldehyde in the product is released into the air as a gas. If the salon is not properly ventilated, you, your stylist, and others in the salon are at risk of inhaling the released formaldehyde.

Why Exposure to Formaldehyde is Dangerous

When formaldehyde is released into the air and is present in the air at levels exceeding 0.1 ppm, it can cause serious irritation of your eyes, nose, and lungs. It can also cause skin sensitivity or allergic dermatitis.

Formaldehyde Exposure: Potential Short-and Long-Term Effects

The greater the exposure to products that contain formaldehyde in terms of both length of time and concentration, the higher the potential health risks. Individuals who have experienced formaldehyde exposure have described reactions such as eye problems or irritation, nervous system problems (for example, headaches and dizziness), respiratory tract problems (sore or scratchy throat, cough, wheezing), nausea, chest pain, vomiting, and rashes. Chronic effects associated with formaldehyde can include an increased prevalence of headaches, asthma, contact dermatitis (a red, itchy rash caused by direct contact with a substance or an allergic reaction to it as a result of sensitization) and possibly cancer.

It’s important to note that some people are very sensitive to formaldehyde, whereas others have no reaction to the same level of exposure. If you are sensitive to formaldehyde, you should not use this type of product.

Steps to Take If You’re Thinking of Using Hair Smoothing Products

Don’t do it yourself. Don’t apply them yourself at home. Go to a licensed hair professional in a salon. Hair professionals should be trained to take precautions such as wearing gloves and safety glasses, as well as making sure that there is proper ventilation when applying hair smoothing products. For more information, please visit OSHA Hair Salons: Facts about Formaldehyde in Hair Products. Read the list of ingredients. While the FDA discourages consumers from buying these products for home use, if you are considering purchasing a product from a store or online to apply yourself, read the required list of ingredients. If there isn’t one, don’t buy the product. If the hair smoothing product lists one of these ingredient names on the packaging or company website: formaldehyde, formalin, or methylene glycol, then it means the product contains formaldehyde or will release formaldehyde. Of note, not all hair smoothing products contain formaldehyde, which is why you need to read the label to see what is in the product. You may also want to ask your salon professional these questions: Does the product contain formaldehyde? Is there an ingredient list available for this product that I could read? Would it be possible for me to review the Safety Data Sheet for this product? Have you been trained to apply this product, and do you know the necessary safeguards to minimize exposure to formaldehyde? May I see your training certificate from the manufacturer and the directions for product use? Does the salon have proper ventilation? Do you periodically test the air for adherence to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s limits for formaldehyde? Do you have an alternative hair smoothing product that does not release formaldehyde when heated? Report bad reactions. If you experience a bad reaction to a hair smoothing product, stop using the product and report your symptoms to your health care provider. You can also report your symptom to the FDA by contacting the Consumer Complaint Coordinator in your area or by reporting them online at MedWatch, the FDA’s safety information and adverse reporting program. You also may call MedWatch at 1-800-332-1088 to request a reporting form by mail.

Of note, not all hair smoothing products contain formaldehyde, which is why you need to read the label to see what is in the product. You may also want to ask your salon professional these questions: Does the product contain formaldehyde? Is there an ingredient list available for this product that I could read? Would it be possible for me to review the Safety Data Sheet for this product? Have you been trained to apply this product, and do you know the necessary safeguards to minimize exposure to formaldehyde? May I see your training certificate from the manufacturer and the directions for product use? Does the salon have proper ventilation? Do you periodically test the air for adherence to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s limits for formaldehyde? Do you have an alternative hair smoothing product that does not release formaldehyde when heated? Report bad reactions. If you experience a bad reaction to a hair smoothing product, stop using the product and report your symptoms to your health care provider. You can also report your symptom to the FDA by contacting the Consumer Complaint Coordinator in your area or by reporting them online at MedWatch, the FDA’s safety information and adverse reporting program. You also may call MedWatch at 1-800-332-1088 to request a reporting form by mail.

220,Study of Mosquito Protein Could Lead to Treatments Against Life Threatening Viruses,"Study of mosquito protein could lead to treatments against life-threatening viruses

NIAID

The mosquito protein AEG12 strongly inhibits the family of viruses that cause yellow fever, dengue, West Nile, and Zika and weakly inhibits coronaviruses, according to scientists at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and their collaborators. The researchers found that AEG12 works by destabilizing the viral envelope, breaking its protective covering. Although the protein does not affect viruses that do not have an envelope, such as those that cause pink eye and bladder infections, the findings could lead to therapeutics against viruses that affect millions of people around the world. The research was published online in PNAS.

Scientists at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), part of NIH, used X-ray crystallography to solve the structure of AEG12. Senior author Geoffrey Mueller, Ph.D., head of the NIEHS Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Group, said at the molecular level, AEG12 rips out the lipids, or the fat-like portions of the membrane that hold the virus together.

""It is as if AEG12 is hungry for the lipids that are in the virus membrane, so it gets rid of some of the lipids it has and exchanges them for the ones it really prefers,"" Mueller said. ""The protein has high affinity for viral lipids and steals them from the virus.""

As a result, Mueller says the AEG12 protein has great killing power over some viruses. While the researchers demonstrated that AEG12 was most effective against flaviviruses, the family of viruses to which Zika, West Nile, and others belong, it is possible AEG12 could be effective against SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. But, Mueller said it will take years of bioengineering to make AEG12 a viable therapy for COVID-19. Part of the problem is AEG12 also breaks opens red blood cells, so researchers will have to identify compounds that will make the protein target viruses only.

Alexander Foo, Ph.D., an NIEHS visiting fellow and lead author of the paper, explained that mosquitoes produce AEG12 when they take a blood meal or become infected with flaviviruses. Like humans, mosquitoes mount a vigorous immune response against these viruses, with AEG12 bursting their viral covering. But, at the beginning of the project, Foo and his colleagues knew little about the function of AEG12.

""The prospect of studying a new protein is exciting, yet daunting,"" Foo said. ""Thankfully, we had enough clues and access to a wide range of expertise at NIEHS to piece it together.""

Co-author and crystallography expert Lars Pedersen, Ph.D., is leader of the NIEHS Structure Function Group. He routinely uses information about a molecule’s physical makeup in his work and encourages more scientists to consider using this data in their studies. He said, ""Our research shows that understanding the structure of a protein can be important in figuring out what it does and how it could help treat disease.""

221,Patchy Skin: Vitiligo Explained,"Patchy Skin

Vitiligo Explained

Your skin is often the first thing other people see. You may have noticed that some people have patches of white skin. This discoloring is called vitiligo.

Vitiligo isn’t contagious. It’s an autoimmune disease. That’s a condition in which the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys the body’s own cells.

Normally, your immune system defends your body from germs. But in vitiligo, immune cells kill the cells that produce the skin’s color. These pigment cells are called melanocytes.

Sometimes, vitiligo causes areas of hair to go white as well. People with vitiligo may also develop inflammationHeat, swelling, and redness caused by the body’s protective response to injury or infection. in the eyes or ears. These parts of the body also contain melanocytes.

To diagnose vitiligo, your doctor will look closely at your skin. They may use a special type of light that makes spots of vitiligo look chalky. You might also have a skin sample taken to look for pigment cells.

The condition isn’t painful. But some people experience itching while the skin is losing color, explains Dr. John Harris, a skin expert at the University of Massachusetts.

Some people feel distressed at the loss of their skin’s color. They may develop low self-esteem or a poor self-image from concerns about their appearance.

“Vitiligo can cause a reduction in quality of life, because it tends to involve parts of the body that can’t be hidden,” says Harris. But treatments are available. And special makeup can help hide the discoloring.

Some treatments aim to slow or stop the disease from getting worse. Others may restore the skin’s color. But these can take time to work. And some areas of the body are easier to treat than others.

A type of light therapy called UVB phototherapy is commonly used to treat the disorder. It uses special lamps that encourage the pigment cells in your skin to regrow.

Light therapy works better on some parts of the body than others. For example, it rarely works well on the hands, Harris says, “but the face is the easiest to treat.”

Some people may need medications that suppress the immune system. These can be given as skin creams or pills.

If someone stops treatment, vitiligo comes back, Harris explains. His team is looking for ways to make the immune system “forget” the melanocytes. That would prevent it from attacking them.

Drugs that suppress the immune system “are like cutting the power to the house to turn off the light in your bedroom,” says Harris. “We want to create more targeted therapies.”

In severe cases of vitiligo, surgery or bleaching larger areas of the skin to match the white patches may be options. Talk with your health care provider about what steps you can take to help with the condition. See the Wise Choices box for tips on living with vitiligo.",newsinhealth.nih.gov
222,Vaccine Safety: MedlinePlus Health Topic,"Summary

What are vaccines?

Vaccines play an important role in keeping us healthy. They protect us from serious and sometimes deadly diseases. Vaccines are injections (shots), liquids, pills, or nasal sprays that you take to teach your body's immune system to recognize and defend against harmful germs. The germs could be viruses or bacteria.

Some types of vaccines contain germs that cause disease. But the germs have been killed or weakened enough that they won't make you sick. Some vaccines only contain a part of a germ. Other types of vaccines include instructions for your cells to make a protein of the germ.

These different vaccine types all spark an immune response, which helps your body fight off the germs. Your immune system will also remember the germ and attack it if that germ ever invades again. This protection against a certain disease is called immunity.

These diseases can be very serious. Because of this, getting immunity from a vaccine is safer than getting immunity by being sick with the disease. And for a few vaccines, getting vaccinated can actually give you a better immune response than getting the disease would.

Do vaccines cause side effects?

As with medicines, any vaccine can cause side effects. Most of the time the side effects are minor, such as a sore arm, fatigue, or mild fever. They usually go away within a few days. These common side effects are often a sign that your body is starting to build immunity against a disease.

Serious side effects from vaccines can happen, but they are very rare. These side effects could include a severe allergic reaction. Other possible side effects are different for each vaccine. Talk with your health care provider if you're concerned about your health after getting vaccinated.

Some people worry that childhood vaccines could cause autism spectrum disorder (ASD). But many scientific studies have looked at this and have found no link between vaccines and ASD.

How are vaccines tested for safety?

Every vaccine that is approved in the United States goes through extensive safety testing. It starts with testing and evaluation of the vaccine before it's approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This process can often take several years.

First, the vaccine is tested in labs. Based on those tests, the FDA decides whether to test the vaccine with people.

Testing with people is done through clinical trials. In these trials, the vaccines are tested on volunteers. Clinical trials usually start with 20 to 100 volunteers, but eventually include thousands of volunteers.

The clinical trials have three phases. The trials are looking for the answer to important questions such as Is the vaccine safe? What dose (amount) works best? How does the immune system react to it? How effective is it?

During the process, the FDA works closely with the company who makes the vaccine to evaluate the vaccine's safety and effectiveness. If the vaccine is found to be safe and effective, it will be approved and licensed by the FDA.

After a vaccine is licensed, experts may consider adding it to the recommended vaccine, or immunization, schedule. This schedule is from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It lists which vaccines are recommended for different groups of people. They list which age groups should get which vaccines, how many doses they need, and when they should get them.

Testing and monitoring continue after the vaccine is approved:

The company making the vaccines tests every batch of vaccines for quality and safety. The FDA reviews the results of these tests. It also inspects the factories where the vaccine is made. These checks help make sure the vaccines meet standards for quality and safety.

The FDA, CDC, and other federal agencies continue to monitor its safety, to watch for possible side effects. They have systems to track any safety issues with the vaccines.

These high safety standards and testing help to make sure that vaccines in the United States are safe. Vaccines help protect against serious, even deadly, diseases. They not only protect you, but also help to keep these diseases from spreading to others.",medlineplus.gov
223,How to Prepare Your Child for a Lab Test,"What happens to my child during a lab test?

Common lab tests for children include blood tests, urine tests, swab tests, and throat cultures.

Blood tests are used to test for many different diseases and conditions. During a blood test, a sample will be taken from a vein in the arm, a fingertip, or a heel.

If done on a vein , a health care professional will take a sample, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial.

, a health care professional will take a sample, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. A fingertip blood test is done by pricking your child's fingertip.

test is done by pricking your child's fingertip. Heel stick tests are used for newborn screenings, a test given shortly after birth to almost every baby born in the United States. Newborn screenings are used to help diagnose a variety of serious health conditions. During a heel stick test, a health care provider will clean your baby's heel with alcohol and poke the heel with a small needle.

During a blood test, encourage your child to look at you, rather than at the person drawing the blood. You should also provide physical comfort and distraction.

Urine tests are done to check for different diseases and for infections of the urinary tract. During a urine test, your child will need to provide a urine sample in a special cup. Unless your child has an infection or a rash, a urine test is not painful. But it can be stressful. The following tips may help.

Talk to your child's provider to find out if a ""clean catch"" method will be needed. For a clean catch urine sample, your child will need to: Clean their genital area with a cleansing pad Start to urinate into the toilet Move the collection container under the urine stream Collect at least an ounce or two of urine into the container, which should have markings to indicate the amounts Finish urinating into the toilet

If a clean catch sample is needed, practice at home. Ask your child to let out a bit of urine in the toilet, stop the flow, and start again.

Encourage your child to drink water before the appointment, but not go to the bathroom. This may make it easier to urinate when it's time to collect the sample.

Turn on the tap. The sound of running water can help your child begin to urinate.

Swab tests help diagnose different types of respiratory infections. During a swab test, a health care provider will:

Gently insert a cotton-tipped swab inside your child's nostril. For some swab tests, a provider may need to insert the swab deeper, until the reaches the uppermost part of the nose and throat, known as the nasopharynx.

Rotate the swab and leave it in place for 10-15 seconds.

Remove the swab and insert into the other nostril.

Swab the second nostril using the same technique.

Swab tests may tickle the throat or cause your child to cough. A swab of the nasopharynx may be uncomfortable and cause a gag reflex when the swab touches the throat. Let your child know beforehand that gagging may happen, but it will be over quickly. It may also help to tell your child that the swab is similar to the cotton swabs you have at home.

Throat cultures are done to check for bacterial infections of the throat, including strep throat. During a throat culture:

Your child will be asked to tilt their head back and open their mouth as wide as possible.

Your child's provider will use a tongue depressor to hold down your child's tongue.

The provider will use a special swab to take a sample from the back of the throat and tonsils.

A throat swab isn't painful, but like some swab tests, it can cause gagging. Let your child know what to expect and that any discomfort shouldn't last very long.",medlineplus.gov

I've heard about heavy metals in baby food. How can I keep my baby safe?

- Keeley

Heavy metals are found in soil, water, and the air we breathe. Plants take up these metals as they grow and can end up in the food we eat. Our bodies need some heavy metals (like iron and zinc) to work well, but other heavy metals (like arsenic and lead) are harmful. Some crops, like rice, absorb more of these harmful metals than others. Heavy metals can build up in the body over time and cause problems with learning, behavior, and attention.

When making baby food, companies add vitamins and minerals along with food additives that may contain heavy metals. Some baby foods have higher levels of heavy metals than others, including:

infant rice cereal

infant rice puff snacks

teething biscuits and rice rusks

fruit juice

carrots and sweet potatoes

Even organic baby food can have heavy metals in it.

The amount of heavy metals is low in baby foods, but you can take steps to lower it even more. Here are ways to do that:",kidshealth.org

My toddler wants to breastfeed only when he’s upset or tired. Is it healthy to continue breastfeeding if nursing has turned into a comfort ritual more than anything else?

Your toddler may turn to nursing for comfort and reassurance, but he is certainly still benefiting from the nutritional and immunologic benefits. In any case, emotional support is a perfectly legitimate aspect of breastfeeding.

Seeking out a reassuring nursing session when he’s upset and bouncing back as soon as he finishes builds your child’s confidence and feelings of security and well-being. Certainly there is no evidence that extended breastfeeding makes a child more dependent or harms him in any way.

227,Healthy Food Choices for Your Family,"Page Content

​How can you ensure that your child is well nourished?

Here are some tips to keep in mind when planning and preparing meals for your family.

Variety

Your child should consume a variety of foods from the five major food groups. Each food group supplies important nutrients, including vitamins and minerals.



The five food groups and typical minimum servings:

Vegetables: 3-5 servings per day. A serving may consist of 1 cup of raw leafy vegetables, 3/4 cup of vegetable juice, or 1/2 cup of other vegetables, chopped raw or cooked.

Fruits: 2-4 servings per day. A serving may consist of 1/2 cup of sliced fruit, 3/4 cup of fruit juice, or a medium-size whole fruit, like an apple, banana, or pear.

Bread, cereal, or pasta: 6-11 servings per day. Each serving should equal 1 slice of bread, 1/2 cup of rice or pasta, or 1 ounce of cereal.

Protein foods: 2-3 servings of 2-3 ounces of cooked lean meat, poultry, or fish per day. A serving in this group may also consist of 1/2 cup of cooked dry beans, one egg, or 2 tablespoons of peanut butter for each ounce of lean meat.

Dairy products: 2-3 servings per day of 1 cup of low-fat milk or yogurt, or 1 1/2 ounces of natural cheese.

Fiber​

Fiber is a carbohydrate component of plant foods that is usually un-digestible. It is found in foods like fruits, vegetables, whole-grain breads, cereals, brown rice, beans, seeds, and nuts.

In adults: Increased fiber has been linked with a reduction of chronic gastrointestinal problems, including colon cancer, irritable bowel syndrome, and diverticulitis.

In children: Fiber's only proven benefit is its ability to ease constipation—providing bulk that can promote regular bowel movements, soften the stools, and decrease the time it takes food to travel through the intestines. But since food preferences and eating habits often get searly in life, and since high-fiber foods contain other nutrients, parents should include these foods in children's daily diets. See Kids Need Fiber: Here's Why and How.

Protein

Your child needs protein so their body can grow and function properly. This includes building new tissues and producing antibodies that help fight infections. Without essential amino acids (the building blocks of protein), children would be much more susceptible to serious diseases.

Protein-rich plants—such as dried beans and peas (legumes), grains, seeds, and nuts—can be used as valuable sources of protein. Other protein-rich foods include meat, fish, milk, yogurt, cheese, and eggs. These animal products contain high-quality protein and a full array of amino acids.

Keep in mind, however, that while red meat and shellfish are rich in protein and an important source of iron, they can also be high in fat and cholesterol as well. So, your child should consume them only in moderate amounts. Select lean cuts of meat and trim the fat before cooking. Likewise, remove skin from poultry before serving.

Fat

Humans cannot live without fats. They are a concentrated source of energy, providing essential fatty acids that are needed for a variety of bodily processes (metabolism, blood clotting, and vitamin absorption).

However, high fat intake—particularly a diet high in saturated fats—can cause problems. Saturated fats are usually solid at room temperatures and are found in fatty meats (such as beef, pork, ham, veal, and lamb) and many dairy products (whole milk, cheese, and ice cream). They can contribute to the buildup of plague in blood vessels and lead to heart disease later in life. A diet rich in saturated fats also can increase blood cholesterol, particularly in people who have inherited a tendency toward high cholesterol levels.

After age two: Children should be served foods that are lower in fat and saturated fats. Chances are that your child's favorite foods are higher in fat than is desirable. Healthy ating means relying more on low-fat, low-cholesterol foods like poultry, fish, and lean meat (broiled, baked, or roasted; not fried), soft margarine (instead of butter), low-fat dairy products, and low-saturated-fat oils from vegetables, while limiting egg consumption.

As a general guideline, fats should make up less than 30% of the calories in your child's diet. No more than about 1/3 or less of those fat calories should come from from saturated fat, with the rest coming from unsaturated (that is, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated) fats. These healthier fats are liquid at room temperature and include vegetable oils like corn, safflower, sunflower, soybean, and olive.

Some parents find the information about various types of fat confusing. In general, oils and fats that come from animals are saturated. The simplest place to start is just to reduce the amount of fatty foods of all types in your family's diet. See How to Reduce Fat and Cholesterol in Your Child's Diet.

Sugar

Limit the amount of sugar in your child's diet to to moderate levels. Sugar has plenty of calories, but dietitians often call them “empty calories"" because they have very little additional nutritional value. Even so, many children consume sugar in large amounts, usually at the expense of healthier foods. When children drink sodas, for example, they are usually leaving the milk in the refrigerator; when they eat a brownie, they may be overlooking the bowl of fruit, a good source of complex carbohydrates, on the kitchen table.

Salt

Table salt, or sodium chloride, may improve the taste of certain foods. However, researchers have found a relationship between salt in the diet and high blood pressure in some people.

High blood pres­sure afflicts about 25% of adult Americans ​​and contributes to heart attacks and strokes.

The habit of using extra salt is an learned one. So, as much as possible, serve your child foods low in salt. In the kitchen, minimize the amount of salt you add to food as you prepare it. Try using herbs, spices, or lemon juice instead. Take the salt shaker off the dinner table, or at least limit its use by your family.

Because salt acts a preservative, processed foods often contain large amounts of it. Salt-rich foods may include processed cheese, instant puddings, canned vegetables, canned soups, hot dogs, cottage cheese, salad dressings, pickles, and potato chips and other snacks.

228,Weaning Your Child,"

Larger text size Large text size Regular text size

What Is Weaning?

Weaning is when a baby moves from breast milk to other sources of nourishment. Weaning your baby is a process that takes patience and understanding from both you and your child.

When Is the Right Time to Wean?

When to wean is a personal decision. A mom might be influenced by a return to work, her health or the baby's, or simply a feeling that the time is right.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends feeding babies only breast milk for the first 6 months of life. After that, the AAP recommends a combination of solid foods and breast milk until a baby is at least 1 year old. Then, babies may begin drinking whole cow's milk.

Most experts agree that breastfeeding should continue for as long as it suits mother and baby. Many women choose to wean after their baby's first birthday. At this age, babies are starting to walk, talk, and eat more solid foods. So they may naturally lose interest in nursing.

Other moms breastfeed longer than a year (this is called extended breastfeeding). Extended breastfeeding is a healthy and reasonable option for mothers and children who aren't ready to wean. In fact, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that moms breastfeed for the first 2 years of a child's life.

Weaning does not have to be all-or-nothing. Some women choose to wean during the day and breastfeed at night, depending on their work situation and their schedules.

Whenever you decide to wean, your child may have another time in mind. Some children wean themselves earlier than the mother intended and others resist weaning when the mother is ready. Those wean later in life tend to be more resistant. For example, a 2-year-old toddler may be more attached and less flexible about giving up breastfeeding than a 12-month-old baby. At times like these, it's important to take it slow and be sensitive to each other's needs.

Signs Your Baby May Be Weaning

Some kids are content to nurse indefinitely. But others will give moms clues that they're ready to begin the process of weaning, such as:

seeming disinterested or fussy when nursing

nursing in shorter sessions than before

being easily distracted while nursing

""playing"" at the breast, like constantly pulling on and off or biting. Babies who bite during nursing should immediately be taken off the breast and told, calmly but firmly, ""No biting. Biting hurts.""

nursing for comfort (sucking at the breast but not drawing out the milk)

Approaches to Weaning

To let both mom and baby adjust physically and emotionally to the change, weaning should be done over time.

One approach is to drop one feeding session a week until your child takes all the feeds from a bottle or cup. If you want to give your child pumped breast milk, you'll need to pump to keep up your milk supply. If you are weaning your child off breast milk, slowly dropping feeds can help avoid engorgement.

You might begin by stopping the midday feeding because it's usually the smallest and most inconvenient — especially for working moms. Many mothers let go of the bedtime feeding last because it's still a special part of bonding.

Some moms leave the decision of when to wean up to their child. Children who are eating three meals of solid food a day (plus snacks) often breastfeed less and less. In that case, a mom's milk will dry up from lack of demand and she'll need to pump to keep the milk flowing. If your child is breastfeeding less, make sure he or she is getting enough iron-fortified formula or milk. Check with the doctor about how much your child should get.

If your baby weans before 1 year of age, or you find that you're not making enough milk, you will need to give your baby formula. Check with the doctor to see what formula is right for your little one.

Making the Change Easier

Weaning is easier if a child has also taken milk from another source. So try giving an occasional bottle of breast milk to your little one after breastfeeding is well-established. Even if you continue breastfeeding, this can ease weaning later. It also lets other family members feed the baby and makes it possible to leave your child with a caregiver.

Remember that infants over 6 months should have solid foods as well as breast milk. After 1 year, breast milk alone does not provide all the nutrients a growing child needs. So solid foods must become a regular part of the diet.

As you start to wean, remember that your child needs time to adjust to drinking from cups. Be patient as your little one begins exploring the world of food.

Here are some more ways to make this change easier:

Engage your child in a fun play activity or an outing during times when you would usually nurse.

Avoid sitting in your usual nursing spots or wearing your usual nursing clothes.

Delay weaning if your child is trying to adapt to some other change. Trying to wean when your little one is just beginning childcare or during teething might not be a good idea.

If your baby is younger than 1 year, try to introduce a bottle or cup when you would typically be nursing. For an older child, try a healthy snack, offering a cup, or maybe a cuddle.

Try changing your daily routine so that you're otherwise engaged during breastfeeding times.

Enlist your partner's help to provide a distraction at a typical nursing time.

If your child picks up a comforting habit (such as thumbsucking) or becomes attached to a security blanket, don't discourage it. Your child might be trying to adjust to the emotional changes of weaning.

How You Might Feel

Many moms make the decision to wean with mixed emotions. Weaning brings more freedom and flexibility, and the proud realization that a child is reaching a milestone. But nursing is an intimate activity that fosters a strong bond between mother and child — and some women find it hard to let that go.

So expect a wide range of emotions, and understand that your child may have them too. Also remember that there will be countless other ways to nurture your child in the days ahead.",kidshealth.org

230,4 Physical Activity Tips for Older Adults,"Regular physical activity is great for your mental and physical health. It also helps you stay independent as you age.

Every day presents opportunities to move more.

The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommend that you aim to exercise at least 150 minutes every week at a moderate pace, or 75 at a more vigorous pace. The guidelines also recommend that older adults do muscle-strengthening activities at least 2 days a week.

Now sure how to get started? These tips can help.

1. Talk with your doctor. Almost anyone, at any age, can exercise safely. If you're concerned about starting an exercise routine, talk with your doctor. Ask whether there are activities you should avoid and whether any health conditions you have might affect what exercises you can do safely.

2. Start gradually. Begin with low-intensity exercises like walking. Be sure to drink plenty of water before, during, and after your workout.

3. Develop a well-rounded routine. Include the four main types of exercise:

Endurance exercises increase your breathing and heart rate. Brisk walking is a good option.

Strength exercises, like lifting weights or using a resistance band, make your muscles stronger.

Balance exercises can help prevent falls. This includes standing on one foot.

Flexibility exercises, like yoga, stretch your muscles and help you stay limber and maintain mobility as you age.

4. Move throughout the day. Every day presents opportunities to move more. For example, use the stairs instead of taking the elevator. Or park far away from the grocery store entrance instead of in the closest spot.",magazine.medlineplus.gov
231,Measuring Blood Pressure,"What do the results mean?

Your results, also known as a blood pressure reading, will contain two numbers. The top or first number is the systolic pressure. The bottom or second number is the diastolic pressure. High blood pressure readings are also labeled by categories, ranging from normal to crisis. Your reading may show your blood pressure is:

Blood Pressure Category Systolic Blood Pressure

Diastolic Blood Pressure Normal Less than 120 and Less than 80 High Blood Pressure (no other heart risk factors) 140 or higher or 90 or higher High Blood Pressure (with other heart risk factors, according to some providers) 130 or higher or 80 or higher Dangerously high blood pressure - seek medical care right away 180 or higher and 120 or higher

If you've been diagnosed with high blood pressure, your provider may recommend lifestyle changes and/or medicines to control your blood pressure. Your provider may also recommend that you regularly check your blood pressure at home with an automated blood pressure monitor. An at-home blood pressure monitor usually includes a blood pressure cuff and a digital device to record and display blood pressure readings.

Home monitoring is not a replacement for regular visits to your provider. But it can provide important information, such as whether treatment is working or your condition may have worsened. Also, home monitoring may make the test less stressful. Many people get nervous about getting their blood pressure taken at a provider's office. This is called ""white coat syndrome."" It can cause a temporary rise in blood pressure, making the results less accurate. For more information about home monitoring of blood pressure, talk to your provider.

test is done by pricking your child's fingertip. Heel stick tests are used for newborn screenings, a test given shortly after birth to almost every baby born in the United States. Newborn screenings are used to help diagnose a variety of serious health conditions. During a heel stick test, a health care provider will clean your baby's heel with alcohol and poke the heel with a small needle.

During a blood test, encourage your child to look at you, rather than at the person drawing the blood. You should also provide physical comfort and distraction.

Urine tests are done to check for different diseases and for infections of the urinary tract. During a urine test, your child will need to provide a urine sample in a special cup. Unless your child has an infection or a rash, a urine test is not painful. But it can be stressful. The following tips may help.

Talk to your child's provider to find out if a ""clean catch"" method will be needed. For a clean catch urine sample, your child will need to: Clean their genital area with a cleansing pad Start to urinate into the toilet Move the collection container under the urine stream Collect at least an ounce or two of urine into the container, which should have markings to indicate the amounts Finish urinating into the toilet

If a clean catch sample is needed, practice at home. Ask your child to let out a bit of urine in the toilet, stop the flow, and start again.

Encourage your child to drink water before the appointment, but not go to the bathroom. This may make it easier to urinate when it's time to collect the sample.

Turn on the tap. The sound of running water can help your child begin to urinate.

Swab tests help diagnose different types of respiratory infections. During a swab test, a health care provider will:

Gently insert a cotton-tipped swab inside your child's nostril. For some swab tests, a provider may need to insert the swab deeper, until the reaches the uppermost part of the nose and throat, known as the nasopharynx.

Rotate the swab and leave it in place for 10-15 seconds.

Remove the swab and insert into the other nostril.

Swab the second nostril using the same technique.

Swab tests may tickle the throat or cause your child to cough. A swab of the nasopharynx may be uncomfortable and cause a gag reflex when the swab touches the throat. Let your child know beforehand that gagging may happen, but it will be over quickly. It may also help to tell your child that the swab is similar to the cotton swabs you have at home.

Throat cultures are done to check for bacterial infections of the throat, including strep throat. During a throat culture:

Your child will be asked to tilt their head back and open their mouth as wide as possible.

Your child's provider will use a tongue depressor to hold down your child's tongue.

The provider will use a special swab to take a sample from the back of the throat and tonsils.

A throat swab isn't painful, but like some swab tests, it can cause gagging. Let your child know what to expect and that any discomfort shouldn't last very long.",medlineplus.gov

236,Pregnancy Check-Ups: Healthy Start for Mom and Baby,"Pregnancy Check-Ups

Healthy Start for Mom and Baby

Life is busy before a baby arrives. There are many things to do to prepare. One of the most important is to visit your health care provider regularly.

Check-ups before your baby is born are called prenatal visits. They help make sure you and your baby are healthy. Your health care provider will look for certain problems that can happen during pregnancy. Some issues are best treated early. Others can be prevented before they start.

“Prenatal care is fundamental for shaping the lives of women and their children,” says Dr. Monica Longo, an NIH expert on prenatal health. Longo cares for women with high-risk pregnancies. Such women have a higher chance of complications.

If you think you may be pregnant, schedule a visit with your provider. If you’re pregnant, you’ll need to start regular prenatal visits. Most women have check-ups about once a month in the beginning. Then, they go more often later in the pregnancy.

During a prenatal visit, your provider will ask about your health history. They will also perform a physical exam and weight check. They’ll let you know how much weight gain is healthy for your body and help track your progress.

You’ll also be asked to provide a urine sample. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common during pregnancy. UTIs and other infections increase the risk of having a preterm birth. This is when you give birth at 37 weeks or earlier.

“One of the primary purposes of prenatal care is actually prevention,” says Longo. “We screen women to find potential health problems before those issues can worsen.”

During certain stages of pregnancy, your provider will perform blood tests and imaging tests. These include ultrasound exams to look at the baby’s growth and development. Visits are also an opportunity to talk with your provider about how to give your baby a healthy start.

“During prenatal visits, we educ-ate and counsel moms about healthy habits, healthy food choices, and exercise,” Longo says. “We also address any concerns a new mom-to-be might have.”

Taking a prenatal vitamin is also key. Folic acid is included in most prenatal vitamins. It reduces the risk of severe birth defects that affect the developing brain and spine.

It’s important to stay away from things that could harm your baby. These include certain medications, smoking, and alcoholic drinks. Also, talk with your provider about any health conditions. Conditions like diabetes (a disease that causes high blood sugar) and high blood pressure need to be brought under control.

Some women choose to talk with their provider before becoming pregnant. This is called a preconception visit. It can help you plan for a safer pregnancy.

Early and regular care for you and your developing baby is important. Studies show that prenatal care reduces the risk of having a low-birth weight baby. Low birth weight can cause health problems. Even during the pandemic, it’s essential to keep up with regular prenatal care.

“Providers around the globe have adapted prenatal care to fit the current challenges,” says Longo. That means using telehealth for visits that don’t have to be done in person.

Health care providers are also seeing fewer patients and extending the time between them. This reduces possible exposure in waiting rooms.

“Providers are prepared for these difficult times,” says Longo. So it’s crucial that moms-to-be keep up with prenatal care.",newsinhealth.nih.gov

244,When to Give Kids Medicine for Coughs and Colds,"Español

Although most colds in children don’t cause serious complications, they can cause anxiety in parents and caregivers. And colds are among the top reasons children visit a doctor. Both non-prescription (over-the-counter) and prescription medicines are available to treat cough and cold symptoms. But most children will get better on their own and may not need medicine.

Some cough and cold medicines also have serious side effects, such as slowed breathing, which can be life-threatening, especially in infants and young children, so it’s important to know when your child needs medication and when they can do without it.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration wants you to be aware of the following information about use of medicines for cough and colds in children:

The FDA doesn’t recommend over-the-counter (OTC) medicines for cough and cold symptoms in children younger than 2 years old.

Prescription cough medicines containing codeine or hydrocodone are not indicated for use in children younger than 18 years old. Codeine and hydrocodone are opioids that are available in combination with other medicines, such as antihistamines and decongestants, in prescription medicines to treat cough and symptoms associated with allergies or the common cold for adults.

Caregivers should also read labels on OTC cough and cold products, because some might contain codeine.

Here are some other tips on how to safely treat your child’s cough and cold.

Relieving Cold and Cough Symptoms

There’s no cure for the common cold, a viral infection that can’t be treated with antibiotics. Typically, a cold will run its course in a week or two, and children will usually get better on their own, without medication. For older children, some non-prescription medicines can help relieve the symptoms of a cold—but won’t change the natural course of the cold or make it go away faster.

Coughs are a normal symptom of a cold and help the body clear the mucus out of the airway and protect the lungs. Non-drug treatments for coughs include drinking plenty of fluids, especially warm drinks to soothe the throat.

When to Call a Doctor

Not every sniffle or cough merits a trip to the doctor’s office. When in doubt, parents should call their health care provider.

For all children, call a doctor if you see any of these symptoms:

A fever in an infant 2 months or younger

A fever of 102 degrees or higher at any age

Blue lips

Labored breathing, including nostrils widening with each breath, wheezing, fast breathing, the ribs showing with each breath or shortness of breath

Not eating or drinking, with signs of dehydration (such as decreased urination)

Excessive crankiness or sleepiness

Persistent ear pain

If the cough lasts for more than three weeks

If the child is getting worse

These symptoms can signal that your child may have something more serious than a cold.

What to Do About Fever and Other Symptoms Associated With a Cold

Fever helps the body fight off an infection and does not always need to be treated. But if your child is uncomfortable because of fever or other symptoms of a cold, there are alternatives to cough and cold medicine to help them feel more comfortable. They include:

A clean cool-mist vaporizer or humidifier in a small area near the child’s bed can help moisten the air and decrease the drying of the nasal passages and throat.

For infants with a stuffy nose, use saline or saltwater drops/spray to moisten nasal passages and loosen mucus. Then clean the nose with a bulb syringe or other suction tool designed for infants.

Acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help reduce fever, aches and pains. Take care to use the correct dose, consulting a health care provider for patients younger than age 2.

Giving the Right Dose of Medicine

How can you be sure to give the correct dose? Follow the directions on the “Drug Facts” label. The FDA encourages drug manufacturers to provide a dosing instrument, such as a syringe or a cup, marked with the correct measurements. Use them—and not household spoons or tools from other medications—to measure medication.

If you have questions, ask a pharmacist or your health care provider. They can tell you which dosing instrument to use, how much medication to give, and how often based on the Drug Facts label.

In the United States, adults average about three colds per year, and children have colds even more often. You might be tempted to give your children pain relievers, decongestants and other medications for a cold. But often it’s best to fight this common childhood illness with rest and care, using medications only when the symptoms are too uncomfortable or make it difficult for the patient to breathe or sleep.",www.fda.gov
245,How Radiation Therapy Is Used to Treat Cancer,"How Radiation Therapy Is Used to Treat Cancer

Radiation is one of the most common treatments for cancer. Other names for radiation treatment are radiation therapy, radiotherapy, irradiation, and x-ray therapy.

What is radiation therapy?

Radiation therapy uses high-energy particles or waves, such as x-rays, gamma rays, electron beams, or protons, to destroy or damage cancer cells.

Your cells normally grow and divide to form new cells. But cancer cells grow and divide faster than most normal cells. Radiation works by making small breaks in the DNA inside cells. These breaks keep cancer cells from growing and dividing and cause them to die. Nearby normal cells can also be affected by radiation, but most recover and go back to working the way they should.

While chemotherapy and other treatments that are taken by mouth or injection usually expose the whole body to cancer-fighting drugs, radiation therapy is usually a local treatment. This means it’s usually aimed at and affects only the part of the body needing treatment. Radiation treatments are planned so that they damage cancer cells with as little harm as possible to nearby healthy cells.

Some radiation treatments (systemic radiation therapy) use radioactive substances that are given in a vein or by mouth. Even though this type of radiation does travel throughout the body, the radioactive substance mostly collects in the area of the tumor, so there’s still little effect on the rest of the body.

Who gets radiation therapy?

More than half of people with cancer get radiation therapy. Sometimes, radiation therapy is the only cancer treatment needed and sometimes it's used with other types of treatment. The decision to use radiation therapy depends on the type and stage of cancer, and other health problems a patient might have.

What are the goals of radiation therapy?

Most types of radiation therapy don’t reach all parts of the body, which means they’re not helpful in treating cancer that has spread to many places within the body. Still, radiation therapy can be used to treat many types of cancer either alone or in combination with other treatments. While it's important to remember each cancer and each person is different, radiation is often the treatment of choice for the following purposes.

To cure or shrink early-stage cancer

Some cancers are very sensitive to radiation. Radiation may be used by itself in these cases to make the cancer shrink or completely go away. In some cases, chemotherapy or other anti-cancer drugs may be given first. For other cancers, radiation may be used before surgery to shrink the tumor (this is called pre-operative therapy or neoadjuvant therapy), or after surgery to help keep the cancer from coming back (called adjuvant therapy).

For certain cancers that can be cured either by radiation or by surgery, radiation may be the preferred treatment. This is because radiation can cause less damage and the part of the body involved may be more likely to work the way it should after treatment.

For some types of cancer, radiation and chemotherapy or other types of anti-cancer drugs might be used together. Certain drugs (called radiosensitizers) help radiation work better by making cancer cells more sensitive to radiation. Research has shown that when anti-cancer drugs and radiation are given together for certain types of cancer, they can help each other work even better than if they were given alone. One drawback, though, is that side effects are often worse when they are given together.

To stop cancer from coming back (recurring) somewhere else

Cancer can spread from where it started to other body parts. Doctors often assume that a few cancer cells might already have spread even when they can’t be seen on imaging scans like CT scans or MRIs. In some cases, the area where the cancer most often spreads to may be treated with radiation to kill any cancer cells before they grow into tumors. For instance, people with certain kinds of lung cancer may get radiation to the head, even when there is no cancer known to be there, because their type of lung cancer often spreads to the brain. This is done to help prevent cancer from spreading to the head even before it can. Sometimes, radiation to prevent future cancer can be given at the same time that radiation is given to treat existing cancer, especially if the area the cancer might spread to is close to the tumor itself.

To treat symptoms caused by advanced cancer

Sometimes cancer has spread too much to be cured. But some of these tumors can still be treated to make them smaller so that the person can feel better. Radiation might help relieve problems like pain, trouble swallowing or breathing, or bowel blockages that can be caused by advanced cancer. This is called palliative radiation.

To treat cancer that has returned (recurred)

If a person's cancer has returned (recurred), radiation might be used to treat the cancer or to treat symptoms caused by advanced cancer. Whether radiation will be used after recurrence depends on many factors. For instance, if the cancer has come back in a part of the body that has already been treated with radiation, it might not be possible to give more radiation in the same place. It depends on the amount of radiation that was used before. In other instances, radiation might be used in the same area of the body or a different area. Some tumors do not respond as well to radiation, so radiation might not be used even if they recur.

How is radiation therapy given?

Radiation therapy can be given in 3 ways:

External radiation (or external beam radiation) : uses a machine that directs high-energy rays from outside the body into the tumor. It’s done during outpatient visits to a hospital or treatment center. It's usually given over many weeks and sometimes will be given twice a day for several weeks. A person receiving external radiation is not radioactive and does not have to follow special safety precautions at home.

A person receiving external radiation is not radioactive and does not have to follow special safety precautions at home. Internal radiation: Internal radiation is also called brachytherapy. A radioactive source is put inside the body into or near the tumor. With some types of brachytherapy, radiation might be placed and left in the body to work. Sometimes it is placed in the body for a period of time and then removed. This is decided based on the type of cancer. Special safety precautions are needed for this type of radiation for a period of time. But it's important to know if the internal radiation is left in the body, after a while it eventually is no longer radioactive.

Systemic radiation: Radioactive drugs given by mouth or put into a vein are used to treat certain types of cancer. These drugs then travel throughout the body. You might have to follow special precautions at home for a period of time after these drugs are given.

The type of radiation you might get depends on the kind of cancer you have and where it is. In some cases, more than one type is used. Your cancer care team can answer specific questions about the type of radiation prescribed for you, how it affects your body, and any precautions that may be needed.

Does radiation therapy cause cancer?

It has long been known that radiation therapy can slightly raise the risk of getting another cancer. It’s one of the possible side effects of treatment that doctors have to think about when they weigh the benefits and risks of each treatment. For the most part, the risk of a second cancer from these treatments is small and is outweighed by the benefit of treating the cancer, but the risk is not zero. This is one of the many reasons each case is different and each person must be part of deciding which kind of treatment is right for them. The risk is different depending on where the radiation treatment will be in the body.

If your cancer care team recommends radiation treatment, it’s because they believe that the benefits you’ll get from it will outweigh the possible side effects. Still, this is your decision to make. Knowing as much as you can about the possible benefits and risks can help you be sure that radiation therapy is best for you.

Does radiation therapy affect pregnancy or fertility?

Females: It’s important not to become pregnant while getting radiation – it can harm the growing baby. If there’s a chance you might become pregnant, be sure to talk to your doctor about birth control options.

If you are or might be pregnant, let your doctor know right away.

If the area getting radiation in your body includes the ovaries, it is possible that the dose of radiation can cause the ovaries to no longer work (sterility), and that you would be unable to have children. it is important to know the risk of this possibility in advance of receiving radiation therapy. If you are thinking about radiation therapy that will affect the ovaries, talk to your doctor about how this might affect having children in the future.

Males: Not much is known about radiation’s effect on the children conceived by men while getting radiation therapy. Because of this, doctors often advise men to not get a woman pregnant during and for some weeks after treatment. Talk to your doctor to find out more about this.

If the area getting radiation includes the testicles, it is possible that the dose of radiation can cause the testicles to no longer work (sterility) and that you would be unable to have children. It is important to know the risk of this possibility in advance of receiving radiation therapy. There is no clear research about how sperm that is exposed to radiation affects future children made from that sperm. If you are thinking about radiation therapy that will affect the testicles, talk to your doctor about how this might affect having children in the future.

But blood testing can be useful in helping to diagnose a pheochromocytoma tumor. If you have this tumor, certain substances will be released into the bloodstream.

For a catecholamine urine test, your health care provider will ask you to collect all urine during a 24-hour period. This is called a 24-hour urine sample test. For 24-hour urine sample test, your health care provider or a laboratory professional will give you a container to collect your urine and instructions on how to collect and store your samples. Test instructions usually include the following steps:

Empty your bladder in the morning and flush that urine away. Record the time.

For the next 24 hours, save all your urine passed in the container provided.

Store your urine container in the refrigerator or a cooler with ice.

Return the sample container to your health provider's office or the laboratory as instructed.

During a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle.

248,How Radiation Therapy Is Used to Treat Cancer,"How Radiation Therapy Is Used to Treat Cancer

Radiation is one of the most common treatments for cancer. Other names for radiation treatment are radiation therapy, radiotherapy, irradiation, and x-ray therapy.

What is radiation therapy?

Radiation therapy uses high-energy particles or waves, such as x-rays, gamma rays, electron beams, or protons, to destroy or damage cancer cells.

Your cells normally grow and divide to form new cells. But cancer cells grow and divide faster than most normal cells. Radiation works by making small breaks in the DNA inside cells. These breaks keep cancer cells from growing and dividing and cause them to die. Nearby normal cells can also be affected by radiation, but most recover and go back to working the way they should.

While chemotherapy and other treatments that are taken by mouth or injection usually expose the whole body to cancer-fighting drugs, radiation therapy is usually a local treatment. This means it’s usually aimed at and affects only the part of the body needing treatment. Radiation treatments are planned so that they damage cancer cells with as little harm as possible to nearby healthy cells.

Some radiation treatments (systemic radiation therapy) use radioactive substances that are given in a vein or by mouth. Even though this type of radiation does travel throughout the body, the radioactive substance mostly collects in the area of the tumor, so there’s still little effect on the rest of the body.

Who gets radiation therapy?

More than half of people with cancer get radiation therapy. Sometimes, radiation therapy is the only cancer treatment needed and sometimes it's used with other types of treatment. The decision to use radiation therapy depends on the type and stage of cancer, and other health problems a patient might have.

What are the goals of radiation therapy?

Most types of radiation therapy don’t reach all parts of the body, which means they’re not helpful in treating cancer that has spread to many places within the body. Still, radiation therapy can be used to treat many types of cancer either alone or in combination with other treatments. While it's important to remember each cancer and each person is different, radiation is often the treatment of choice for the following purposes.

To cure or shrink early-stage cancer

Some cancers are very sensitive to radiation. Radiation may be used by itself in these cases to make the cancer shrink or completely go away. In some cases, chemotherapy or other anti-cancer drugs may be given first. For other cancers, radiation may be used before surgery to shrink the tumor (this is called pre-operative therapy or neoadjuvant therapy), or after surgery to help keep the cancer from coming back (called adjuvant therapy).

For certain cancers that can be cured either by radiation or by surgery, radiation may be the preferred treatment. This is because radiation can cause less damage and the part of the body involved may be more likely to work the way it should after treatment.

For some types of cancer, radiation and chemotherapy or other types of anti-cancer drugs might be used together. Certain drugs (called radiosensitizers) help radiation work better by making cancer cells more sensitive to radiation. Research has shown that when anti-cancer drugs and radiation are given together for certain types of cancer, they can help each other work even better than if they were given alone. One drawback, though, is that side effects are often worse when they are given together.

To stop cancer from coming back (recurring) somewhere else

Cancer can spread from where it started to other body parts. Doctors often assume that a few cancer cells might already have spread even when they can’t be seen on imaging scans like CT scans or MRIs. In some cases, the area where the cancer most often spreads to may be treated with radiation to kill any cancer cells before they grow into tumors. For instance, people with certain kinds of lung cancer may get radiation to the head, even when there is no cancer known to be there, because their type of lung cancer often spreads to the brain. This is done to help prevent cancer from spreading to the head even before it can. Sometimes, radiation to prevent future cancer can be given at the same time that radiation is given to treat existing cancer, especially if the area the cancer might spread to is close to the tumor itself.

To treat symptoms caused by advanced cancer

Sometimes cancer has spread too much to be cured. But some of these tumors can still be treated to make them smaller so that the person can feel better. Radiation might help relieve problems like pain, trouble swallowing or breathing, or bowel blockages that can be caused by advanced cancer. This is called palliative radiation.

To treat cancer that has returned (recurred)

If a person's cancer has returned (recurred), radiation might be used to treat the cancer or to treat symptoms caused by advanced cancer. Whether radiation will be used after recurrence depends on many factors. For instance, if the cancer has come back in a part of the body that has already been treated with radiation, it might not be possible to give more radiation in the same place. It depends on the amount of radiation that was used before. In other instances, radiation might be used in the same area of the body or a different area.

What Is a Gene Mutation?

A gene mutation (myoo-TAY-shun) is a change in one or more genes. Some mutations can lead to genetic disorders or illnesses.

What Are Genes?

Genes are short sections of DNA. They determine our traits, which are things like hair color, height, body type, and other things that make a person unique. Genes also play a role in a person's risk for some diseases and health conditions. Each of us has about 24,000 different types of genes.

What Is DNA?

DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is the carrier of all our genes. Each person gets one copy of DNA from their mother and one copy from their father. DNA creates a code using four chemicals called nucleotides (NEW-klee-uh-tydes). This code determines which genes a person has. DNA is located inside the chromosomes.

What Is a Chromosome?

A chromosome (KRO-muh-sohm) is an X-shaped thread-like structure in the body's cells. It contains DNA. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes.

What Causes a Gene Mutation?

A gene can mutate because of:

a change in one or more nucleotides of DNA

a change in many genes

loss of one or more genes

rearrangement of genes or whole chromosomes

Do Parents Pass Gene Mutations to Children?

If a parent carries a gene mutation in their egg or sperm, it can pass to their child. These hereditary (or inherited) mutations are in almost every cell of the person's body throughout their life. Hereditary mutations include cystic fibrosis, hemophilia, and sickle cell disease.

Other mutations can happen on their own during a person's life. These are called sporadic, spontaneous, or new mutations. They affect only some cells. Damage from the sun's ultraviolet radiation or exposure to some types of chemicals can lead to new mutations. These mutations are not passed from parents to their children.

Do All Gene Mutations Cause Health Problems?

Most gene mutations have no effect on health. And the body can repair many mutations. Some mutations are even helpful. For example, people can have a mutation that protects them from heart disease or gives them harder bones.",kidshealth.org

252,Study of Mosquito Protein Could Lead to Treatments Against Life Threatening Viruses,"Study of mosquito protein could lead to treatments against life-threatening viruses

NIAID

The mosquito protein AEG12 strongly inhibits the family of viruses that cause yellow fever, dengue, West Nile, and Zika and weakly inhibits coronaviruses, according to scientists at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and their collaborators. The researchers found that AEG12 works by destabilizing the viral envelope, breaking its protective covering. Although the protein does not affect viruses that do not have an envelope, such as those that cause pink eye and bladder infections, the findings could lead to therapeutics against viruses that affect millions of people around the world. The research was published online in PNAS.

Scientists at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), part of NIH, used X-ray crystallography to solve the structure of AEG12. Senior author Geoffrey Mueller, Ph.D., head of the NIEHS Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Group, said at the molecular level, AEG12 rips out the lipids, or the fat-like portions of the membrane that hold the virus together.

""It is as if AEG12 is hungry for the lipids that are in the virus membrane, so it gets rid of some of the lipids it has and exchanges them for the ones it really prefers,"" Mueller said. ""The protein has high affinity for viral lipids and steals them from the virus.""

As a result, Mueller says the AEG12 protein has great killing power over some viruses. While the researchers demonstrated that AEG12 was most effective against flaviviruses, the family of viruses to which Zika, West Nile, and others belong, it is possible AEG12 could be effective against SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. But, Mueller said it will take years of bioengineering to make AEG12 a viable therapy for COVID-19. Part of the problem is AEG12 also breaks opens red blood cells, so researchers will have to identify compounds that will make the protein target viruses only.

Alexander Foo, Ph.D., an NIEHS visiting fellow and lead author of the paper, explained that mosquitoes produce AEG12 when they take a blood meal or become infected with flaviviruses. Like humans, mosquitoes mount a vigorous immune response against these viruses, with AEG12 bursting their viral covering. But, at the beginning of the project, Foo and his colleagues knew little about the function of AEG12.

""The prospect of studying a new protein is exciting, yet daunting,"" Foo said. ""Thankfully, we had enough clues and access to a wide range of expertise at NIEHS to piece it together.""

Co-author and crystallography expert Lars Pedersen, Ph.D., is leader of the NIEHS Structure Function Group. He routinely uses information about a molecule’s physical makeup in his work and encourages more scientists to consider using this data in their studies. He said, ""Our research shows that understanding the structure of a protein can be important in figuring out what it does and how it could help treat disease.""

253,Vaccine Safety: MedlinePlus Health Topic,"Summary

What are vaccines?

Vaccines play an important role in keeping us healthy. They protect us from serious and sometimes deadly diseases. Vaccines are injections (shots), liquids, pills, or nasal sprays that you take to teach your body's immune system to recognize and defend against harmful germs. The germs could be viruses or bacteria.

Some types of vaccines contain germs that cause disease. But the germs have been killed or weakened enough that they won't make you sick. Some vaccines only contain a part of a germ. Other types of vaccines include instructions for your cells to make a protein of the germ.

These different vaccine types all spark an immune response, which helps your body fight off the germs. Your immune system will also remember the germ and attack it if that germ ever invades again. This protection against a certain disease is called immunity.

These diseases can be very serious. Because of this, getting immunity from a vaccine is safer than getting immunity by being sick with the disease. And for a few vaccines, getting vaccinated can actually give you a better immune response than getting the disease would.

Do vaccines cause side effects?

As with medicines, any vaccine can cause side effects. Most of the time the side effects are minor, such as a sore arm, fatigue, or mild fever. They usually go away within a few days. These common side effects are often a sign that your body is starting to build immunity against a disease.

Serious side effects from vaccines can happen, but they are very rare. These side effects could include a severe allergic reaction. Other possible side effects are different for each vaccine. Talk with your health care provider if you're concerned about your health after getting vaccinated.

Some people worry that childhood vaccines could cause autism spectrum disorder (ASD). But many scientific studies have looked at this and have found no link between vaccines and ASD.

How are vaccines tested for safety?

Every vaccine that is approved in the United States goes through extensive safety testing. It starts with testing and evaluation of the vaccine before it's approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This process can often take several years.

First, the vaccine is tested in labs. Based on those tests, the FDA decides whether to test the vaccine with people.

Testing with people is done through clinical trials. In these trials, the vaccines are tested on volunteers. Clinical trials usually start with 20 to 100 volunteers, but eventually include thousands of volunteers.

The clinical trials have three phases. The trials are looking for the answer to important questions such as Is the vaccine safe? What dose (amount) works best? How does the immune system react to it? How effective is it?

During the process, the FDA works closely with the company who makes the vaccine to evaluate the vaccine's safety and effectiveness. If the vaccine is found to be safe and effective, it will be approved and licensed by the FDA.

After a vaccine is licensed, experts may consider adding it to the recommended vaccine, or immunization, schedule. This schedule is from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It lists which vaccines are recommended for different groups of people. They list which age groups should get which vaccines, how many doses they need, and when they should get them.

Testing and monitoring continue after the vaccine is approved:

The company making the vaccines tests every batch of vaccines for quality and safety. The FDA reviews the results of these tests. It also inspects the factories where the vaccine is made. These checks help make sure the vaccines meet standards for quality and safety.

The FDA, CDC, and other federal agencies continue to monitor its safety, to watch for possible side effects. They have systems to track any safety issues with the vaccines.

These high safety standards and testing help to make sure that vaccines in the United States are safe. Vaccines help protect against serious, even deadly, diseases. They not only protect you, but also help to keep these diseases from spreading to others.",medlineplus.gov

COVID-19. We’ve been living with it for what sometimes seems like forever. Given the number of deaths that have occurred from the disease, it’s perhaps not surprising that some consumers are looking at unconventional treatments, not approved or authorized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Though this is understandable, please beware. The FDA’s job is to carefully evaluate the scientific data on a drug to be sure that it is both safe and effective for a particular use, and then to decide whether or not to approve it. Using any treatment for COVID-19 that’s not approved or authorized by the FDA, unless part of a clinical trial, can cause serious harm.

There seems to be a growing interest in a drug called ivermectin to treat humans with COVID-19. Ivermectin is often used in the U.S. to treat or prevent parasites in animals. The FDA has received multiple reports of patients who have required medical support and been hospitalized after self-medicating with ivermectin intended for horses.

Here’s What You Need to Know about Ivermectin

FDA has not approved ivermectin for use in treating or preventing COVID-19 in humans. Ivermectin tablets are approved at very specific doses for some parasitic worms, and there are topical (on the skin) formulations for head lice and skin conditions like rosacea. Ivermectin is not an anti-viral (a drug for treating viruses).

Taking large doses of this drug is dangerous and can cause serious harm.

If you have a prescription for ivermectin for an FDA-approved use, get it from a legitimate source and take it exactly as prescribed.

Never use medications intended for animals on yourself. Ivermectin preparations for animals are very different from those approved for humans.

What is Ivermectin and How is it Used?

Ivermectin tablets are approved by the FDA to treat people with intestinal strongyloidiasis and onchocerciasis, two conditions caused by parasitic worms. In addition, some topical (on the skin) forms of ivermectin are approved to treat external parasites like head lice and for skin conditions such as rosacea.

Some forms of ivermectin are used in animals to prevent heartworm disease and certain internal and external parasites. It’s important to note that these products are different from the ones for people, and safe when used as prescribed for animals, only.

When Can Taking Ivermectin Be Unsafe?

The FDA has not reviewed data to support use of ivermectin in COVID-19 patients to treat or to prevent COVID-19; however, some initial research is underway. Taking a drug for an unapproved use can be very dangerous. This is true of ivermectin, too.

There’s a lot of misinformation around, and you may have heard that it’s okay to take large doses of ivermectin. That is wrong.

Even the levels of ivermectin for approved uses can interact with other medications, like blood-thinners. You can also overdose on ivermectin, which can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hypotension (low blood pressure), allergic reactions (itching and hives), dizziness, ataxia (problems with balance), seizures, coma and even death.

Ivermectin Products for Animals Are Different from Ivermectin Products for People

For one thing, animal drugs are often highly concentrated because they are used for large animals like horses and cows, which can weigh a lot more than we do—a ton or more. Such high doses can be highly toxic in humans.

Moreover, FDA reviews drugs not just for safety and effectiveness of the active ingredients, but also for the inactive ingredients. Many inactive ingredients found in animal products aren’t evaluated for use in people. Or they are included in much greater quantity than those used in people. In some cases, we don’t know how those inactive ingredients will affect how ivermectin is absorbed in the human body.

Meanwhile, effective ways to limit the spread of COVID-19 continue to be to wear your mask, stay at least 6 feet from others who don’t live with you, wash hands frequently, and avoid crowds.

Antibodies Protect Against COVID-19 Reinfection

NIAID

After having COVID-19, most people’s bodies develop antibodies to help fight it off. These are special molecules made by the body’s disease defense system, the immune system. A study found that people with these antibodies were less likely to get COVID-19 again.

Researchers looked at more than 3 million people who had an antibody test for SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes COVID-19.

They found that about 11% of people had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. More than 88% had a negative test. And less than 1% of tests were inconclusive.

The scientists looked at who came down with COVID-19 after the test. They analyzed up to 30 days, 31–60 days, 61–90 days, and more than 90 days after.

About 3% to 4% of people with negative antibody tests got COVID-19 in each time period. But those who had antibodies were less likely to have COVID-19 as time went on. Only 0.3% of the people with antibodies had a positive COVID-19 test more than 90 days after. Those without antibodies were 10 times more likely to get the disease.

The findings suggest that people who have a positive result from an antibody test may be at lower risk for future infection with SARS-CoV-2.

NIH’s Dr. Lynn Penberthy, who led the research team, explains that more questions still need to be answered. “We are nevertheless encouraged by this early finding,” she says.",newsinhealth.nih.gov

257,Coronavirus and the Nervous System,"What is COVID-19?

Coronaviruses are common causes of usually mild to moderate upper respiratory tract illnesses like the common cold, with symptoms that may include runny nose, fever, sore throat, cough, or a general feeling of being ill. However, a new coronavirus called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged and spread to cause the COVID-19 pandemic.

COVID-19, which means Coronavirus disease 2019, is an infectious disease that can affect people of all ages in many ways. It is most dangerous when the virus spreads from the upper respiratory tract into the lungs to cause viral pneumonia and lung damage leading to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). When severe, this impairs the body’s ability to maintain critical levels of oxygen in the blood stream—which can cause multiple body systems to fail and can be fatal.

What do we know about the effects of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 on the nervous system?

Much of the research to date has focused on the acute infection and saving lives. These strategies have included preventing infection with vaccines, treating COVID-19 symptoms with medicines or antibodies, and reducing complications in infected individuals.

Research shows the many neurological symptoms of COVID-19 are likely a result of the body’s widespread immune response to infection rather than the virus directly infecting the brain or nervous system. In some people, the SARS-CoV-2 infection causes an overreactive response of the immune system which can also damage body systems. Changes in the immune system have been seen in studies of the cerebrospinal fluid, which bathes the brain, in people who have been infected by SARS-CoV-2. This includes the presence of antibodies—proteins made by the immune system to fight the virus—that may also react with the nervous system. Although still under intense investigation, there is no evidence of widespread viral infection in the brain. Scientists are still learning how the virus affects the brain and other organs in the long-term. Research is just beginning to focus on the role of autoimmune reactions and other changes that cause the set of symptoms that some people experience after their initial recovery. It is unknown if injury to the nervous system or other body organs cause lingering effects that will resolve over time, or whether COVID-19 infection sets up a more persistent or even chronic disorder.

What are the immediate (acute) effects of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 on the brain?

Most people infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus will have no or mild to moderate symptoms associated with the brain or nervous system. However, most hospitalized patients do have symptoms related to the brain or nervous system, most commonly including muscle aches, headaches, dizziness, and altered taste and smell. Some people with COVID-19 either initially have, or develop in the hospital, a dramatic state of confusion called delirium. Although rare, COVID-19 can cause seizures or major strokes. Muscular weakness, nerve injury, and pain syndromes are common in people who require intensive care during infections. There are also very rare reports of conditions that develop after SARS-CoV-2 infection, as they sometimes do with other types of infections. These disorders of inflammation in the nervous system include Guillain-Barré syndrome (which affects nerves), transverse myelitis (which affects the spinal cord), and acute necrotizing leukoencephalopathy (which affects the brain).

Bleeding in the brain, weakened blood vessels, and blood clots in acute infection

The SARS-CoV-2 virus attaches to a specific molecule (called a receptor) on the surface of cells in the body. This molecule is concentrated in the lung cells but is also present on certain cells that line blood vessels in the body. The infection causes some arteries and veins – including those in the brain – to become thin, weaken, and leak. Breaks in small blood vessels have caused bleeding in the brain (so-called microbleeds) in some people with COVID-19 infection. Studies in people who have died due to COVID-19 infection show leaky blood vessels in different areas of the brain that allow water and a host of other molecules as well as blood cells that are normally excluded from the brain to move from the blood stream into the brain. This leak, as well as the resulting inflammation around blood vessels, can cause multiple small areas of damage. COVID-19 also causes blood cells to clump and form clots in arteries and veins throughout the body. These blockages reduce or block the flow of blood, oxygen, and nutrients that cells need to function and can lead to a stroke or heart attack.

A stroke is a sudden interruption of continuous blood flow to the brain. A stroke occurs either when a blood vessel in the brain becomes blocked or narrowed or when a blood vessel bursts and spills blood into the brain. Strokes can damage brain cells and cause permanent disability. The blood clots and vascular (relating to the veins, capillaries, and arteries in the body) damage from COVID-19 can cause strokes even in young healthy adults who do not have the common risk factors for stroke.

COVID-19 can cause blood clots in other parts of the body, too. A blood clot in or near the heart can cause a heart attack. A heart attack or Inflammation in the heart, called myocarditis, can cause heart failure, and reduce the flow of blood to other parts of the body. A blood clot in the lungs can impair breathing and cause pain. Blood clots also can damage the kidneys and other organs.

Low levels of oxygen in the body (called hypoxia) can permanently damage the brain and other vital organs in the body. Some hospitalized individuals require artificial ventilation on respirators. To avoid chest movements that oppose use of the ventilator it may be necessary to temporarily “paralyze” the patient and use anesthetic drugs to put the individual to sleep. Some individuals with severe hypoxia require artificial means of bringing oxygen into their blood stream, a technique called extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Hypoxia combined with these intensive care unit measure generally cause cognitive disorders that show slow recovery.

Diagnostic imaging of some people who have had COVID-19 show changes in the brain’s white matter that contains the long nerve fibers, or “wires,” over which information flows from one brain region to another. These changes may be due to a lack of oxygen in the brain, the inflammatory immune system response to the virus, injury to blood vessels, or leaky blood vessels. This “diffuse white matter disease” might contribute to cognitive difficulties in people with COVID-19. Diffuse white matter disease is not uncommon in individuals requiring intensive hospital care but it not clear if it also occurs in those with mild to moderate severity of COVID-19 illness.

What is the typical recovery from COVID-19?

Fortunately, people who have mild to moderate symptoms typically recover in a few days or weeks. However, some people who have had only mild or moderate symptoms of COVID-19 continue to experience dysfunction of body systems—particularly in the lungs but also possibly affecting the liver, kidneys, heart, skin, and brain and nervous system—months after their infection. In rare cases, some individuals may develop new symptoms (called sequelae) that stem from but were not present at the time of initial infection. People who require intensive care for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, regardless of the cause, usually have a long period of recovery. Individuals with long-term effects, whether following mild or more severe COVID-19, have in some cases self-identified as having “long COVID” or “long haul COVID.” These long-term symptoms are included in the scientific term, P ost A cute S equelae of SARS- C oV-2 Infection (PASC).

top

What are possible long-term neurological complications of COVID-19?

Researchers are following some known acute effects of the virus to determine their relationship to the post-acute complications of COVID-19 infection. These post-acute effects usually include fatigue in combination with a series of other symptoms. These may include trouble with concentration and memory, sleep disorders, fluctuating heart rate and alternating sense of feeling hot or cold, cough, shortness of breath, problems with sleep, inability to exercise to previous normal levels, feeling sick for a day or two after exercising (post-exertional malaise), and pain in muscle, joints, and chest. It is not yet known how the infection leads to these persistent symptoms and why in some individuals and not others.

Nerve damage, including peripheral neuropathy

Some symptoms experienced by some people weeks to months after COVID infection suggest the peripheral nervous system, the vast communication network that sends signals between the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord) and all other parts of the body, is impaired. Peripheral nerves send many types of sensory information to the central nervous system (CNS), such as a message that the feet are cold. They also carry signals from the CNS to the rest of the body, including those that control voluntary movement. Nerve dysfunction is also a known complication in those with critical care illness such as the acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Symptoms of peripheral neuropathy vary depending on the type of nerves – motor, sensory, or autonomic – that are damaged.

Motor nerves control the movement of all muscles under conscious control, such as those used for walking, grasping things, or talking. Damage to the motor nerves can cause muscle weakness and cramps.

Sensory nerves carry messages from our sense of touch, sight, hearing, taste, and smell. Sensory nerves transmit information such as the feeling of a light touch, temperature, or pain. The symptoms of sensory nerve damage can include loss of sense of touch, temperature, and pain or a tingling sensation.

carry messages from our sense of touch, sight, hearing, taste, and smell. Sensory nerves transmit information such as the feeling of a light touch, temperature, or pain. The symptoms of sensory nerve damage can include loss of sense of touch, temperature, and pain or a tingling sensation. Autonomic nerves control organs to regulate activities that people do not control consciously, such as breathing, digestion, and heart and gland functions. Common symptoms include excess or absence of sweating, heat intolerance, and drop in blood pressure upon standing. Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (also known as POTS) can increase heart rate when standing up and cause such symptoms as lightheadedness (or fainting) or difficulty concentrating.

Fatigue and post-exertional malaise.

The most common persistent symptom weeks and months after COVID-19 infection is fatigue. The fatigue is similar to what one experiences with many viral infections such as the flu. The sense of fatigue can be brought on by both physical and mental activity. Some people are unable to return to work or school after COVID-19 due to fatigue, while others find it extremely difficult to accomplish their normal level of activity. Tasks such as walking the dog or going shopping can cause extreme tiredness and fatigue; some people can’t carry out everyday activities without feeling pain or tiredness. COVID-related complications such as depressed heart, lung, or kidney function, poor sleep, or muscle deconditioning are known to cause fatigue and affect the ability to exercise. Fatigue is very common in most inflammatory conditions. The cause(s) of fatigue in many of those suffering weeks and months after COVID-19 is not known.

Post-exertional malaise (PEM) is a condition in which otherwise usual activities are followed by a period of very severe fatigue and sense of feeling sick. PEM can occur with a delay after the activity, but can last for days thereafter.

Cognitive impairment/altered mental state

People with severe acute COVID-19 illness may develop confusion, delirium, and a depressed level of consciousness. Those suffering from post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 frequently have difficulty concentrating and memory problems, sometimes called “brain fog.” This impairment is a common symptom in those with severe fatigue of any cause. A variety of immune, metabolic, or blood vessel abnormalities or drug effects can contribute to the dramatic effects on cognitive function in the acute infection. Whether these also underlie the problems experienced weeks or months after mild or moderate illness is not known.

Muscle, joint, and chest pain

Some people continue to report pain in a muscle or group of muscles (myalgia), aching joints, and fatigue after recovering from the initial course of the virus. Persistent muscle pain and chest pain is commonly reported by persons recovering from ARDS, but is now being reported by those who had a mild or moderate infectious illness. Some individuals also have a sense of shortness of breath despite testing normal on pulmonary function tests.

Prolonged/lingering loss of smell (anosmia) or taste

Some people who have had COVID-19 may lose their sense of taste or smell, or the sensation of flavor. The loss of sense of taste or smell is characteristic of COVID-19 because the SARS-CoV-2 virus infects the tissue that forms the lining in the nose. The virus has been found to target certain cells in the nose that support the nerve cells. Those nerve cells detect odors and send that information to the brain. Damage to these supporting cells can cause smell or taste loss that can continue for weeks or months as these cells repair themselves or are replaced by new cells. During the recovery period some odors may smell different - even sometimes unpleasant or foul - than people remeber prior to being infected.

Persistent fevers and chills

Some people who recover from their acute (short-term) infection continue to have on-and-off fever, along with chills and body ache. Some people have a high, prolonged fever after the infection is gone, which might contribute to the sense of fatigue. In some instances, people who recover from the initial infection may have temperature dysregulation, in which it’s difficult for the body to keep a normal temperature.

Prolonged respiratory effects and lung damage

COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory disease that can seriously affect the lungs during and after the infection. Some people with the disease have breathing difficulties and some require supplemental oxygen support or mechanical ventilation via a respirator. The disease also can damage the muscles that help us breathe. Lung injury can cause low blood oxygen and brain hypoxia, which occurs when the brain isn’t getting enough oxygen. This can lead to cognitive impairment, seizures, stroke, and permanent damage to the brain and other organs. Results from several studies show that, even in people who have had mild-to-moderate infection, the effects of COVID-19 can persist in the lungs for months. Some people develop pneumonia after their acute illness has passed. Several people need pulmonary (lung) rehabilitation to rebuild their lung function. Studies show several people who had the infection, particularly those who had a more severe course of illness, also develop scarring of the lung and permanent lung dysfunction.

Headaches

Headaches are often among the many symptoms that can accompany infection from the coronavirus. Some people continue to have mild to serious headaches sometimes for weeks after recovery. The sensation of pressure is different from a migraine, which may be brought on by stress. The headaches may be infrequent or occur chronically (some people report having daily headache).

Sleep disturbances

Some people with long-term neurological effects from the SARS-CoV-2 infection report having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep (insomnia), excessive daytime sleepiness (hypersomnia), unrefreshing sleep, and changes in sleep patterns. It may be difficult for some people to wake up and fall asleep at their regular times. Depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can negatively affect sleep. Sleep disorders can contribute to fatigue and cognitive troubles. Some people report an increase in pain, headache, and stress because of lack of sleep. Continued loss of sleep also negatively affects attention and mood. For more information about COVID-19’s effect on sleep (as well as on the respiratory system) and tips to improve sleep, see the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.

Anxiety, depression, and stress post-COVID

The outbreak of COVID-19 is stressful for many people. People respond to stress in different ways and it is normal to experience a range of emotions, including fear, anxiety, and grief. Being isolated from others during the infection, the real risk of death, and the stress of hospitalization and critical care can trigger post-traumatic stress disorder. In addition, given the contagious nature of COVID-19, the individual is often not the only affected person in the family or circle of friends, some of whom may even have died. Some people may develop a mood or anxiety disorder. For information on post-COVID stress and coping, see the National Institute of Mental Health’s resources at National Institute of Mental Health's (NIMH) Director, Dr. Gordon In the News and NIMH Shareable Resources on Coping with COVID-19.

How do the long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection/COVID-19 relate to Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS)?

Some of the symptom clusters reported by people still suffering months after their COVID-19 infection overlap with symptoms described by individuals with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). People with a diagnosis of ME/CFS have wide-ranging and debilitating effects including fatigue, PEM, unrefreshing sleep, cognitive difficulties, postural orthostatic tachycardia, and joint and muscle pain. Unfortunately, many people with ME/CFS do not return to pre-disease levels of activity. The cause of ME/CFS is unknown but many people report its onset after an infectious-like illness. Rest, conserving energy, and pacing activities are important to feeling better but don’t cure the disease. Although the long-term symptoms of COVID-19 may share features with it, ME/CFS is defined by symptom-based criteria and there are no tests that confirm an ME/CFS diagnosis.

ME/CFS is not diagnosed until the key features, especially severe fatigue, post-exertional malaise, and unrefreshing sleep, are present for greater than six months. It is now becoming more apparent that following infection with SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19, some individuals may continue to exhibit these symptoms beyond six months and qualify for an ME/CFS diagnosis. It is unknown how many people will develop ME/CFS after SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is possible that many individuals with ME/CFS, and other disorders impacting the nervous system, may benefit greatly if research on the long-term effects of COVID-19 uncovers the cause of debilitating symptoms including intense fatigue, problems with memory and concentration, and pain.

Am I at a higher risk if I currently have a neurological disorder?

Much is still unknown about the coronavirus but people having one of several underlying medical conditions may have an increased risk of illness. However, not everyone with an underlying condition will be at risk of developing severe illness. People who have a neurological disorder may want to discuss their concerns with their doctors.

Because COVID-19 is a new virus, there is little information on the risk of getting the infection in people who have a neurological disorder. People with any of these conditions might be at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19:

Cerebrovascular disease

Stroke

Obesity

Dementia

Diabetes

High blood pressure

There is evidence that COVID-19 seems to disproportionately affect some racial and ethnic populations, perhaps because of higher rates of pre-existing conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and lung disease. Social determinants of health (such as access to health care, poverty, education, ability to remain socially distant, and where people live and work) also contribute to increased health risk and outcomes.

top

Can COVID-19 cause other neurological disorders?

In some people, response to the coronavirus has been shown to increase the risk of stroke, dementia, muscle and nerve damage, encephalitis, and vascular disorders. Some researchers think the unbalanced immune system caused by reacting to the coronavirus may lead to autoimmune diseases, but it's too early to tell.

Anecdotal reports of other diseases and conditions that may be triggered by the immune system response to COVID-19 include para-infectious conditions that occur within days to a few weeks after infection:

Multi-system infammatory syndrome - which causes inflammation in the body's blood vessels

Transverse myelitis - an inflammation of the spinal cord

Guillain-Barré sydrome (sometimes known as acute polyradiculoneuritis) - a rare neurological disorder which can range from brief weakness to nearly devastating paralysis, leaving the person unable to breathe independently

Dysautonomia - dysfunction of the autonomic nerve system, which is involved with functions such a breathing, heart rate, and temperature control

Acute disseminating encephalomyelitis (ADEM) - an attack on the protective myelin covering of nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord

Acute necrotizing hemorrhagic encephalopathy - a rare type of brain disease that causes lesions in certain parts of the brain and bleeding (hemorrhage) that can cause tissue death (necrosis)

Facial nerve palsies (lack of function of a facial nerve) such as Bell's Palsy

Parkinson's disease-like symptoms have been reported in a few individuals who had no family history or early signs of the disease

top

Does the COVID-19 vaccine cause neurological problems?

Almost everyone should get the COVID-19 vaccination. It will help protect you from getting COVID-19. The vaccines are safe and effective and cannot give you the disease. Most side effects of the vaccine may feel like flu and are temporary and go away within a day or two. In early vaccine development, there were extremely rare reports of unexplained neurological illness following COVID-19 vaccination, but regulators found no evidence the vaccines caused the illness. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) continues to investigate any report of adverse consequences of the vaccine and none have appeared as of yet. Consult your primary care doctor or specialist if you have concerns regarding any pre-existing known allergic or other severe reactions and vaccine safety. Scientists are studying the risk to benefit ratio of the vaccine in someone who previously developed Guillain Barré syndrome after a vaccination. The general sense is the COVID-19 vaccine is safe in individuals whose Guillain-Barré syndrome was not associated with a previous vaccination.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) site offers information on vaccine resources at https://www.coronavirus.gov/. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has information on vaccines for the coronavirus. See: https://covid19.nih.gov/.

Long COVID

Long COVID is a range of symptoms that can last weeks or months after first being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 or can appear weeks after infection. Long COVID can happen to anyone who has had COVID-19, even if the illness was mild, or they had no symptoms. People with long COVID report experiencing different combinations of the following symptoms:

Tiredness or fatigue

Difficulty thinking or concentrating (sometimes referred to as “brain fog”)

Headache

Loss of smell or taste

Dizziness on standing

Fast-beating or pounding heart (also known as heart palpitations)

Chest pain

Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath

Cough

Joint or muscle pain

Depression or anxiety

Fever

Symptoms that get worse after physical or mental activities

Multiorgan Effects of COVID-19

Multiorgan effects can affect most, if not all, body systems including heart, lung, kidney, skin, and brain functions. Multiorgan effects can also include conditions that occur after COVID-19, like multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) and autoimmune conditions. MIS is a condition where different body parts can become swollen. Autoimmune conditions happen when your immune system attacks healthy cells in your body by mistake, causing painful swelling in the affected parts of the body.

It is unknown how long multiorgan system effects might last and whether the effects could lead to chronic health conditions.

Effects of COVID-19 Treatment or Hospitalization

Post-COVID conditions also can include the longer-term effects of COVID-19 treatment or hospitalization. Some of these longer-term effects are similar to those related to hospitalization for other respiratory infections or other conditions.

Effects of COVID-19 treatment and hospitalization can also include post-intensive care syndrome (PICS), which refers to health effects that remain after a critical illness. These effects can include severe weakness and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD involves long-term reactions to a very stressful event.",www.cdc.gov
259,Dr. Ben Cowling on Super Spreading of COVID-19,"Q&A

Dr. Ben Cowling on Super Spreading of COVID-19

Ben Cowling, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at the University of Hong Kong

Excerpts from our conversation with Dr. Ben Cowling, an NIH-funded epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong.

NIHNiH: What is “super spreading,” and how is it driving the COVID-19 pandemic?

Cowling: We looked at infections in Hong Kong. And what we found is that infections often occurred in clusters. So although on average, one person may have been infecting two others, actually, a lot of the cases didn’t infect anyone.

We found that 70% of cases didn’t affect anyone, didn’t transmit at all. And about 20% of cases were responsible for 80% of transmission. That’s called super-spreading.

NIHNiH: Has this pattern been seen before? Is it limited to Hong Kong?

Cowling: We observe that the minority of cases are responsible for a majority of transmission. It’s not the first time we've seen that happening. That happened for SARS (another coronavirus) in 2003. It happens for MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) coronavirus, as well. And now we think it happens for COVID.

Although our research is in Hong Kong, using Hong Kong data, actually the same kind of phenomenon has been reported elsewhere. And we believe it’s actually what’s happening a lot of the time with COVID in the U.S. as well.

NIHNiH: How does super spreading occur?

Cowling: You need to have a lot of people around a contagious case. If there’s a contagious person who isolates themselves once they worry they’re infected, there won’t be any superspreading because there won’t be an opportunity. You also need the case to be a relatively more contagious case. We’ve found that there’s a lot of variability in contagiousness.

One of the questions we still haven’t answered is: What makes a super-spreader? What is it about those people that makes them more contagious and more likely to transmit to lots of other people? We haven’t really identified it. Maybe there’s some genetic component. Maybe there’s some other factor related to age or social behavior.

NIHNiH: How can we reduce super spreading?

Cowling: If we can find ways to minimize the opportunity for super-spreading events, it would really help a lot. And so that means in the U.S., things like either making sure bars are closed or operating in reduced capacity or with better ventilation. Same for restaurants. Workplaces really need to think about not having a crowded cubicle area, where if there was one infected person in the middle that they could spread it to everyone. Public transport may need to be more careful, especially on public transport that has longer journeys.

NIHNiH: How will limiting super spreading help?

Cowling: If we can find ways to remove one of those ingredients for super-spreading events—and that’s the opportunity—then it can go a long way to reducing transmission. So that’s really, in my opinion, an important approach.

If we can reduce crowding, then we can actually do a lot of good without having to have drastic stay-at-home orders. We can still let people do some of the things they want to do.",newsinhealth.nih.gov

How Long Does Protection Last After COVID-19?

NIAID Integrated Research Facility, Fort Detrick, Maryland

After your body’s disease defense system (the immune system) fights off a virus, it keeps a memory of it. A study suggests that people’s immune systems remember COVID-19 for months after recovery.

The immune system makes different types of cells and molecules to fight disease. These include antibodies, T cells, and B cells.

Researchers looked at immune responses from about 200 people who’d recovered from COVID-19. Some had been infected up to eight months before the analysis. Other cases were more recent. Of the people who recovered, 95% had immune system “memories” of the virus that causes COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2.

Almost everyone had antibodies that block the virus’ spike protein. The virus uses this protein to enter cells. The number and type of antibodies varied between people. But the levels usually remained stable over time. They slightly decreased six to eight months after infection.

Immune cell levels also remained high. Memory B cells, which make antibodies, increased for a few months after infection and then remained stable. Most people had one important type of T cell. About half had another type of T cell that kills infected cells.

“Several months ago, our studies showed that natural infection induced a strong response, and this study now shows that the responses last,” says Dr. Daniela Weiskopf at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology. “We are hopeful that a similar pattern of responses lasting over time will also emerge for the vaccine-induced responses.”",newsinhealth.nih.gov

How To Protect Yourself During the Pandemic

COVID-19 has claimed millions of lives around the world. But we learn more about this disease every day. Scientists are developing tools that promise to slow and eventu­ally help us overcome the pandemic.

COVID-19 is caused by a new coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. There are many types of coronaviruses. Some cause the common cold. Others have led to fatal disease outbreaks. These include severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012, and now COVID-19.

Coronaviruses are named for the crown-like spikes on their surface. (Corona means crown.) The viruses use the spikes to help get inside your body’s cells. Once inside, they replicate, or make copies of themselves.

Scientists have learned how to turn these spikes against the virus through vaccines and treatments. They’ve also learned what you can do to protect yourself from the virus.

Protecting Yourself

You’re most likely to get COVID-19 through close contact with someone who’s infected. Coughing, sneezing, talking, and breathing produce small droplets of liquid. These are called respiratory droplets. They travel through the air and can be inhaled by someone else.

“COVID-19 is spread mainly through exposure to respiratory droplets that tend to drop within six feet,” says Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. That’s why it’s important to stay at least six feet (about two arm lengths) away from people who don’t live with you.

“Surfaces can be contaminated. But it is likely that this is a less common cause of infection rather than person-to-person directly,” Fauci says.

You can protect yourself and others by wearing a mask. Choose one that has at least two layers of fabric. Make sure that the mask covers your mouth and nose and doesn’t leak air around the edges.

“There’s very little transmission in places where masks are worn,” says Dr. Ben Cowling at the University of Hong Kong who studies how viruses spread. Cowling found that infections were most often spread in settings where masks aren’t worn.

“Masks work. But even with mandatory masking, you still need social distancing as well,” he says. You can lower your risk by avoiding crowds. Crowds increase the risk of coming in contact with someone who has COVID-19.

What to Look For

Common symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, headaches, fatigue, and muscle or body aches. People with COVID-19 may also lose their sense of smell or taste. Symptoms usually appear two to 14 days after being exposed to the virus.

But even people who don’t seem sick can still infect others. The CDC estimates that 50% of infections are spread by people with no symptoms. While some with this virus develop life-threatening illness, others have mild symptoms, and some never develop any.

Catching the virus is more dangerous for some groups of people. This includes older adults and people with certain medical conditions. These medical conditions include obesity, diabetes, heart and lung disease, and asthma. About 40% of Americans have at least one of these risk factors.

Getting Treatment

Better COVID-19 treatments mean that fewer people now get severely sick if they catch the virus. Scientists have been working to test available drugs against the virus. They’ve found at least two that can help people who are hospitalized with the virus.

A drug called remdesivir can reduce the time a patient spends in the hospital. A steroid called dexamethasone helps stop the immune systemThe system that protects your body from invading viruses, bacteria, and other microscopic threats. from reacting too strongly to the virus. That can damage body tissues and organs.

Antibody treatments are also available. Antibodies are proteins that your body makes to fight germs. Scientists have learned how to make them in the lab. Antibody treatments can block SARS-CoV-2 to prevent the illness from getting worse. They seem to have the most benefit when given early in the disease.

“Antibody treatments really do have the potential to help people, especially for treating individuals who are not yet hospitalized,” says Dr. Mark Heise, who studies the genetics of viruses at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Heise is working to develop mouse models to test treatments and vaccines.

Studies are now testing combinations of treatments. “Combining drugs that target both the virus and the person’s immune response may help treat COVID-19,” says Heise. Scientists are also looking for new drugs that better target the virus.

A Shot of Hope: Vaccines

It used to take a decade or more to develop a new vaccine. In this pandemic, scientists created COVID-19 vaccines in less than a year.

The first two vaccines approved for emergency use are from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech. Moderna’s vaccine was co-developed with NIH scientists. Both are a new type of vaccine called mRNA vaccines. mRNA carries the genetic information for your body to make proteins.

The vaccines direct the body’s cells to make a piece of the virus called the spike protein. These proteins can’t cause illness by themselves. But they teach your immune system to make antibodies against the protein. If you encounter the virus later, the antibodies provide protection against it.

The mRNA vaccines now available were shown to be more than 90% effective in large clinical trials. They can cause side effects—such as fatigue, muscle aches, joint pain, and headache. But both vaccines were found to be safe in the clinical trials.

“Get vaccinated. The vaccines are safe. They’re incredibly effective,” says Dr. Jason McLellan, an expert on coronaviruses at the University of Texas at Austin. McLellan’s research was critical in developing these vaccines. His team, along with NIH scientists, figured out how to lock the shape of the spike protein to make the most effective antibodies.

As the pandemic has gone on, new versions of the virus, or variants, have appeared. “We’re all very confident that vaccines will continue to work well against these variants,” McLellan says. “Vaccination also helps stop the development of new variants, because it provides fewer opportunities for the virus to change as it replicates.”

Many people will need to be vaccinated for the pandemic to end. Fauci estimates that 70% to 85% of the U.S. population will need to be vaccinated to get “herd immunity.” That’s the point where enough people are immune to the virus to prevent its spread. That’s important because it protects vulnerable people who can’t get vaccinated.

“It is my hope that all Americans will protect themselves by getting vaccinated when the vaccine becomes available to them,” Fauci says. “That is how our country will begin to heal and move forward.”",newsinhealth.nih.gov

CDC and FDA do not provide individual medical treatment, advice, or diagnosis. If you need individual medical or health care advice, consult a qualified healthcare provider.",vaers.hhs.gov
263,FDA and CDC Lift Recommended Pause on Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) COVID-19 Vaccine Use Following Thorough Safety Review,"Following a thorough safety review, including two meetings of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have determined that the recommended pause regarding the use of the Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) COVID-19 Vaccine in the U.S. should be lifted and use of the vaccine should resume.

The pause was recommended after reports of six cases of a rare and severe type of blood clot in individuals following administration of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. During the pause, medical and scientific teams at the FDA and CDC examined available data to assess the risk of thrombosis involving the cerebral venous sinuses, or CVST (large blood vessels in the brain), and other sites in the body (including but not limited to the large blood vessels of the abdomen and the veins of the legs) along with thrombocytopenia, or low blood platelet counts. The teams at FDA and CDC also conducted extensive outreach to providers and clinicians to ensure they were made aware of the potential for these adverse events and could properly manage and recognize these events due to the unique treatment required for these blood clots and low platelets, also known as thrombosis-thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS).

The two agencies have determined the following:

Use of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine should be resumed in the United States.

The FDA and CDC have confidence that this vaccine is safe and effective in preventing COVID-19.

The FDA has determined that the available data show that the vaccine’s known and potential benefits outweigh its known and potential risks in individuals 18 years of age and older.

At this time, the available data suggest that the chance of TTS occurring is very low, but the FDA and CDC will remain vigilant in continuing to investigate this risk.

Health care providers administering the vaccine and vaccine recipients or caregivers should review the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers Administering Vaccine (Vaccination Providers) external icon and Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers external icon , which have been revised to include information about the risk of this syndrome, which has occurred in a very small number of people who have received the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine.

CDC’s independent Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices met today to discuss the latest data on TTS, hearing from the vaccine manufacturer Janssen and the COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Technical (VaST) Subgroup, as well as a risk benefit analysis. ACIP is committed to be vigilant and responsive to additional information that could impact the risk benefit analysis of any of these vaccines. Vaccine safety monitoring will continue and any new information about TTS will be brought to ACIP as needed.

“Safety is our top priority. This pause was an example of our extensive safety monitoring working as they were designed to work—identifying even these small number of cases. We’ve lifted the pause based on the FDA and CDC’s review of all available data and in consultation with medical experts and based on recommendations from the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. We have concluded that the known and potential benefits of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine outweigh its known and potential risks in individuals 18 years of age and older. We are confident that this vaccine continues to meet our standards for safety, effectiveness and quality. We recommend people with questions about which vaccine is right for them have those discussions with their health care provider,” said Janet Woodcock, M.D., Acting FDA Commissioner.

“Above all else, health and safety are at the forefront of our decisions,” said CDC Director Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky. “Our vaccine safety systems are working. We identified exceptionally rare events – out of millions of doses of the Janssen COVID-19 administered – and we paused to examine them more carefully. As we always do, we will continue to watch all signals closely as more Americans are vaccinated. I continue to be encouraged by the growing body of real-world evidence that the authorized COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective, and they protect people from disease, hospitalization, and death. I urge anyone with questions about the COVID-19 vaccines to speak with their healthcare provider or local public health department.”

Assessment of Available Data

Medical and scientific teams at the FDA and CDC reviewed several sources of information and data related to the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine to reach today’s decision.

Specifically, the agencies assessed reports submitted to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS),external icon reviewed the medical literature and considered the information from global regulatory partners about thrombosis with thrombocytopenia that have been reported following use of a similar, yet not identical, COVID-19 vaccine using a virus from the adenovirus family that has been modified to contain the gene for making a protein from SARS-CoV-2.

Update on Adverse Events

On April 13, the FDA and CDC announcedexternal icon that, out of more than 6.8 million doses administered, six reports of a rare and severe type of blood clot combined with low blood platelet levels occurring in people after receiving the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine had been reported to VAERS. In these cases, a type of blood clot called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) was seen in combination with low levels of blood platelets (thrombocytopenia).

Today, the agencies can confirm that a total of 15 cases of TTS have been reported to VAERS, including the original six reported cases. All of these cases occurred in women between the ages of 18 and 59, with a median age of 37 years. Reports indicated symptom onset between 6 and 15 days after vaccination.

Monitoring for Safety Will Continue

The surveillance systems that are in place to monitor the safety of COVID-19 vaccines authorized for emergency use are working, as demonstrated by both agencies’ quick work to identify and investigate these rare, but serious adverse events. The FDA and CDC will continue with these efforts to closely monitor the safety of these vaccines.

264,Recommendation to Pause Use of Johnson & Johnson's Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine,"Since use of COVID-19 vaccines began in the United States, scientists and doctors have constantly and carefully reviewed all reports of vaccine side effects and adverse events. As of April 23, 2021, more than 8 million doses of the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine had been given in the United States. As of April 23, 2021, experts reviewing safety reports for this vaccine found 15 reports of women who got the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine and later developed thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). TTS is a serious condition that involves blood clots with low platelets.

These reports suggest an increased risk of TTS one to two weeks after vaccination with the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. As of April 23, 2021, the reports reviewed all occurred in women between 18 and 59 years old, with a median of 37 years. These reports represent a reporting rate of 7 such events per 1 million vaccinations among women 18 through 49 years old and a rate of 0.9 per 1 million vaccinations among women 50 years and older.

265,What Are mRNA Vaccines and How Do They Work?,"Vaccines help prepare the body to fight foreign invaders (pathogens such as bacteria or viruses), to prevent infection. All vaccines introduce into the body a harmless piece of a particular bacteria or virus, triggering an immune response. Most vaccines contain a weakened or killed bacteria or virus. However, scientists have developed a new type of vaccine that uses a molecule called messenger RNA (or mRNA for short) rather than part of an actual bacteria or virus. Messenger RNA is a type of RNA that is necessary for protein production. In cells, mRNA uses the information in genes to create a blueprint for making proteins. Once cells finish making a protein, they quickly break down the mRNA. mRNA from vaccines does not enter the nucleus and does not alter DNA.

mRNA vaccines work by introducing a piece of mRNA that corresponds to a viral protein, usually a small piece of a protein found on the virus’s outer membrane. (Individuals who get an mRNA vaccine are not exposed to the virus, nor can they become infected by it.) Using this mRNA blueprint, cells produce the viral protein. As part of a normal immune response, the immune system recognizes that the protein is foreign and produces specialized proteins called antibodies. Antibodies help protect the body against infection by recognizing individual viruses or other pathogens, attaching to them, and marking the pathogens for destruction. Once produced, antibodies remain in the body, even after the body has rid itself of the pathogen, so that the immune system can quickly respond if exposed again. If a person is exposed to a virus after receiving mRNA vaccination for it, antibodies can quickly recognize it, attach to it, and mark it for destruction before it can cause serious illness.

Like all vaccines in the United States, mRNA vaccines require authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before they can be used. Currently vaccines for COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, are the only authorized mRNA vaccines. These vaccines use mRNA that directs cells to produce copies of a protein on the outside of the coronavirus known as the “spike protein”. Researchers are studying how mRNA might be used to develop vaccines for additional infectious diseases.",medlineplus.gov

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized three COVID-19 vaccines for emergency use. The vaccines are:

Emergency use authorization (EUA) allows these vaccines to be distributed in the U.S. Learn more about EUAs for COVID-19 vaccines from the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER).

Who authorizes COVID-19 vaccines for emergency use?

The FDA is the authority that has regulatory oversight of the safety, effectiveness and quality of vaccines that are used in the U.S., including COVID-19 vaccines. FDA employees who are career scientists and doctors are the people who decided to authorize COVID-19 vaccines after they thoroughly analyzed and evaluated the data on COVID-19 vaccine safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality.

The FDA may issue an EUA when the agency’s scientific experts have determined that the known and potential benefits of the vaccine outweigh its known and potential risks. FDA employees are fathers, mothers, daughters, sons, sisters, brothers and more. They and their families are directly impacted by the work they do.

Why should I get a COVID-19 vaccine?

When you get a COVID-19 vaccine, you are choosing to protect yourself and make a difference for your children, parents, grandparents, and other loved ones. Millions of people in the U.S. have already received a COVID-19 vaccine. For a community to be fully protected, most community members need to get the vaccine. Getting vaccinated to prevent COVID-19 will help protect you from COVID-19, and it may also protect the people around you.

How do I get a COVID-19 vaccine?

Go to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website to find your state and local health departments who are responsible for COVID-19 vaccine distribution. All questions and concerns should be sent to your state government or local health department. The U.S. government’s goal is to have enough COVID-19 vaccine doses for all people in the U.S. who choose to be vaccinated.

FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines are being distributed for free by states and local communities. If you see vaccines for sale online, or if someone asks you for money to get a vaccine appointment, to put your name on a waiting list, or to get access to a vaccine, it is a scam. You do not need to pay to get a vaccine appointment or to be put on a waiting list.

Do the COVID-19 vaccines work?

Yes. All three FDA-authorized vaccines are effective in preventing COVID-19 and related serious outcomes, including hospitalization and deaths. The FDA thoroughly evaluated and analyzed the safety and effectiveness data for all of the authorized COVID-19 vaccines and determined that the available data for each vaccine provides clear evidence that the known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks of each vaccine.

Do the COVID-19 vaccines work against the new variants?

The available information suggests that the authorized vaccines remain effective in protecting the American public against currently circulating strains of COVID-19. We are already talking with vaccine manufacturers about these new strains and how to quickly and safely make any changes that may be needed in the future.

Some variants spread more easily than others and are more transmissible than the original virus that causes COVID-19. To help slow the spread of COVID-19, get a COVID-19 vaccine when it is available to you. Other ways to slow the spread include:

Wearing a mask

Keeping 6 feet apart from others who don’t live with you

Avoiding crowds and poorly ventilated indoor spaces

Washing your hands often with soap and water (use hand sanitizer if soap and water aren’t available)

How safe are the COVID-19 vaccines?

The FDA evaluated data from clinical studies that included tens of thousands of people for each COVID-19 vaccine. The FDA authorized the vaccines because the data from these studies clearly showed that the known and potential benefits of the FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines outweighed the known and potential risks.



Report vaccine side effects toll-free at 1-800-822-7967 or online to FDA/CDC Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).

Millions of doses of FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines have been given to people all around the country. Serious adverse events following vaccination are very rare. Allergic reactions, some of which are severe, and cases of anaphylaxis have occurred following administration of COVID-19 vaccines. Anaphylaxis is a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction that happens within seconds or minutes of exposure to an allergen. Because of this remote chance of severe allergic reaction or anaphylaxis, health care providers may ask you to stay at the place where you received your COVID-19 vaccine for monitoring for 15 to 30 minutes.

For one vaccine, the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine, there have been cases reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) of a type of blood clot called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) in combination with low levels of platelets in the blood (thrombocytopenia). CVST occurs when a blood clot forms in the brain's venous sinuses. This prevents blood from draining out of the brain. It is a type of rare stroke.

On April 13, 2021, the FDA and CDC recommended a pause in the use of this vaccine out of an abundance of caution while it further investigates these cases and to ensure that the health care provider community is aware of the potential for these adverse events and can plan for proper recognition and management due to the unique treatment required with this type of blood clot.

Can I see the safety and effectiveness data that support the Emergency Use Authorization of the COVID-19 vaccines?

The FDA is publicly sharing information about COVID-19 vaccines so you can see the evidence for yourself. The FDA’s analysis of clinical trial data, as well as demographic information about the clinical study volunteers, is available in the FDA Briefing Document for each vaccine. You can also view the advisory committee webcasts where outside experts discuss the data. The FDA’s reasoning for authorizing each vaccine is available in the FDA Decision Memorandum.

Does the FDA monitor COVID-19 vaccine safety after authorization?

Yes. The FDA and the CDC have several systems in place to continually monitor COVID-19 vaccine safety. These systems, called “passive surveillance” and “active surveillance” systems, rapidly detect and investigate potential safety problems. Systems such as the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and CDC’s text-based v-safe system, which receive reports of adverse events following vaccination, are examples of passive surveillance systems. The FDA‘s BEST Initiative is an example of an active surveillance system, which can rapidly analyze information occurring in millions of individuals recorded in large data systems to investigate any safety signals that are identified by VAERS or v-safe.

Why are the FDA and CDC recommending a pause in the use of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine?

The FDA and CDC are reviewing data involving six cases reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) of a low level of platelets in the blood in combination with a rare and severe type of blood clot called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) in individuals who had received the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. One individual died. All cases occurred in females ranging in age from 18 through 48 years. In some of the reported cases of CVST, blood clots also involved large veins in the abdomen. Out of an abundance of caution, the FDA and CDC are recommending a pause in the use of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine while the FDA and CDC, including through its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices investigate these reports of serious adverse events. This is important, in part, to help ensure that health care providers are aware of the potential for these adverse events and can plan for proper recognition and management due to the unique treatment required for CVST with low levels of platelets. The safety monitoring program that is in place to monitor COVID-19 vaccines is working, as we were able to detect the reports of these very rare, serious adverse events early and take action to assess them. The FDA and CDC will continue to fully investigate all reports to determine if a causal relationship exists.

If I received the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine, am I at risk for these adverse events?

If you received the vaccine a month or more ago, the risk of these events appears to be extremely low. In all six cases, the symptoms occurred 6 to 13 days after vaccination. You should contact your health care provider immediately if you are experiencing any of the following symptoms:

These symptoms are distinct from the commonly reported side effects that people may experience in the first few days following vaccination, which can include headache, fatigue, muscle aches and nausea. Most of these side effects are mild to moderate in severity and last 1-2 days.

shortness of breath

chest pain

leg swelling

persistent abdominal pain

neurological symptoms (including severe or persistent headaches or blurred vision)

a diffuse rash on the skin consisting of pinpoint like spots (petechiae)

What should health care providers look for in evaluating Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine recipients for these rare events?

Healthcare providers should be alert to the signs and symptoms of thromboembolism and/or thrombocytopenia in individuals vaccinated with Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. In the management of cases of thromboembolism with thrombocytopenia following Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine, heparin and its derivatives should be avoided, and health care providers should consider consulting a hematologist.

Pregnant people are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19

Although the overall risk of severe illness is low, pregnant people are at an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 when compared with non-pregnant people. Severe illness includes illness that requires hospitalization, intensive care, or a ventilator or special equipment to breathe, or illness that results in death. Additionally, pregnant people with COVID-19 might be at increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth, compared with pregnant women without COVID-19.

Limited data are available about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines for people who are pregnant

Based on how these vaccines work in the body, experts believe they are unlikely to pose a risk for people who are pregnant. However, there are currently limited data on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnant people.

Clinical trials that study the safety of COVID-19 vaccines and how well they work in pregnant people are underway or planned. Vaccine manufacturers are also collecting and reviewing data from people in the completed clinical trials who received vaccine and became pregnant.

Studies in animals receiving a Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, or J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine before or during pregnancy found no safety concerns in pregnant animals or their babies.

CDC and the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) have safety monitoring systems in place to gather information about COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy and will closely monitor that information. Early dataexternal icon from these systems are preliminary, but reassuring. These data did not identify any safety concerns for pregnant people who were vaccinated or for their babies. Most of the pregnancies reported in these systems are ongoing, so more follow-up data are needed for people vaccinated just before or early in pregnancy. We will continue to follow people vaccinated during all trimesters of pregnancy to understand effects on pregnancy and babies.

The Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines are mRNA vaccines that do not contain the live virus that causes COVID-19 and therefore, cannot give someone COVID-19. Additionally, mRNA vaccines do not interact with a person’s DNA or cause genetic changes because the mRNA does not enter the nucleus of the cell, which is where our DNA is kept. Learn more about how COVID-19 mRNA vaccines work.

The J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine is a viral vector vaccine, meaning it uses a modified version of a different virus (the vector) to deliver important instructions to our cells. Vaccines that use the same viral vector have been given to pregnant people in all trimesters of pregnancy, including in a large-scale Ebola vaccination trial. No adverse pregnancy-related outcomes, including adverse outcomes that affected the infant, were associated with vaccination in these trials.

The researchers found that AEG12 works by destabilizing the viral envelope, breaking its protective covering. Although the protein does not affect viruses that do not have an envelope, such as those that cause pink eye and bladder infections, the findings could lead to therapeutics against viruses that affect millions of people around the world. The research was published online in PNAS.

Scientists at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), part of NIH, used X-ray crystallography to solve the structure of AEG12. Senior author Geoffrey Mueller, Ph.D., head of the NIEHS Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Group, said at the molecular level, AEG12 rips out the lipids, or the fat-like portions of the membrane that hold the virus together.

""It is as if AEG12 is hungry for the lipids that are in the virus membrane, so it gets rid of some of the lipids it has and exchanges them for the ones it really prefers,"" Mueller said. ""The protein has high affinity for viral lipids and steals them from the virus.""

As a result, Mueller says the AEG12 protein has great killing power over some viruses. While the researchers demonstrated that AEG12 was most effective against flaviviruses, the family of viruses to which Zika, West Nile, and others belong, it is possible AEG12 could be effective against SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. But, Mueller said it will take years of bioengineering to make AEG12 a viable therapy for COVID-19. Part of the problem is AEG12 also breaks opens red blood cells, so researchers will have to identify compounds that will make the protein target viruses only.

Alexander Foo, Ph.D., an NIEHS visiting fellow and lead author of the paper, explained that mosquitoes produce AEG12 when they take a blood meal or become infected with flaviviruses. Like humans, mosquitoes mount a vigorous immune response against these viruses, with AEG12 bursting their viral covering. But, at the beginning of the project, Foo and his colleagues knew little about the function of AEG12.

""The prospect of studying a new protein is exciting, yet daunting,"" Foo said. ""Thankfully, we had enough clues and access to a wide range of expertise at NIEHS to piece it together.""

Co-author and crystallography expert Lars Pedersen, Ph.D., is leader of the NIEHS Structure Function Group.

CDC Recommends Hib Vaccines for All Young Children and Certain Other People

CDC recommends Hib vaccination for all children younger than 5 years old. Children need multiple (3 or 4) shots of a Hib vaccine. CDC recommends shots at the following ages:

2 months

4 months

6 months (if needed; depends on brand)

12 through 15 months

Call your child’s doctor if you have questions and to make sure your child received all recommended doses.

Older children and adults usually do not need a Hib vaccine. However, CDC recommends Hib vaccination for people with certain medical conditions. Talk with your or your child’s doctor if you have questions about Hib vaccines.

All children should get the full series of Hib shots as babies and need one booster shot when they are 12 through 15 months old.

Hib Vaccines Are Safe

Most children who get a Hib vaccine do not have any problems with it. However, side effects can occur. Most are mild, meaning they do not affect daily activities, and get better on their own in a few days. Mild side effects can include fever or redness, warmth, or swelling where the doctor gave the shot. See the Hib vaccine information statement to learn more.

check circle solid icon The hepatitis A vaccine is very safe, and it is effective at preventing the hepatitis A disease. Vaccines, like any medicine, can have side effects. These are usually mild and go away on their own.

What are the side effects?

The most common side effects are usually mild and last 1 or 2 days. They include:

Sore arm from the shot

Headache

Tiredness

Fever

Loss of appetite (not wanting to eat)

What is hepatitis A?

Hepatitis A is a serious liver disease caused by the hepatitis A virus. Children with the virus often don’t have symptoms, but they often pass the disease to others, including their unvaccinated parents or caregivers. These individuals can get very sick.

What are the symptoms of hepatitis A disease?

Children under 6 years old often have no symptoms. Older children and adults feel

very sick and weak. Symptoms usually appear 2 to 6 weeks after a person gets the virus.

The symptoms may include

Fever

Loss of appetite (not wanting to eat)

Tiredness

Stomach pain

Vomiting

Dark urine

Yellow skin and eyes

Is it serious?

Older children, adolescents and adults often feel sick and symptoms can last for up to 6 months. There is no specific treatment for hepatitis A.

hospital alt solid icon Hepatitis A is a serious disease that used to be more common in the United States. In the 1980s, the United States used to see as many as 30,000 cases a year. Thanks to the vaccine, the number of hepatitis A cases in the United States has dropped by 95%.

How does hepatitis A spread?

Hepatitis A virus is found in the stool (poop) of a person who has the virus. It spreads when a person puts something in his or her mouth that has the hepatitis A virus on it. Even if the item looks clean, it can still have virus on it that can spread to others. The amount of stool can be so tiny that it cannot be seen with the naked eye. You can get it by touching objects such as doorknobs or diapers or eating food that has the virus on it.",www.cdc.gov
280,Vaccine Safety: MedlinePlus Health Topic,"Summary

What are vaccines?

Vaccines play an important role in keeping us healthy. They protect us from serious and sometimes deadly diseases. Vaccines are injections (shots), liquids, pills, or nasal sprays that you take to teach your body's immune system to recognize and defend against harmful germs. The germs could be viruses or bacteria.

Some types of vaccines contain germs that cause disease. But the germs have been killed or weakened enough that they won't make you sick. Some vaccines only contain a part of a germ. Other types of vaccines include instructions for your cells to make a protein of the germ.

These different vaccine types all spark an immune response, which helps your body fight off the germs. Your immune system will also remember the germ and attack it if that germ ever invades again. This protection against a certain disease is called immunity.

These diseases can be very serious. Because of this, getting immunity from a vaccine is safer than getting immunity by being sick with the disease. And for a few vaccines, getting vaccinated can actually give you a better immune response than getting the disease would.

Do vaccines cause side effects?

As with medicines, any vaccine can cause side effects. Most of the time the side effects are minor, such as a sore arm, fatigue, or mild fever. They usually go away within a few days. These common side effects are often a sign that your body is starting to build immunity against a disease.

Serious side effects from vaccines can happen, but they are very rare. These side effects could include a severe allergic reaction. Other possible side effects are different for each vaccine. Talk with your health care provider if you're concerned about your health after getting vaccinated.

Some people worry that childhood vaccines could cause autism spectrum disorder (ASD). But many scientific studies have looked at this and have found no link between vaccines and ASD.

How are vaccines tested for safety?

Every vaccine that is approved in the United States goes through extensive safety testing. It starts with testing and evaluation of the vaccine before it's approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This process can often take several years.

First, the vaccine is tested in labs. Based on those tests, the FDA decides whether to test the vaccine with people.

Testing with people is done through clinical trials. In these trials, the vaccines are tested on volunteers. Clinical trials usually start with 20 to 100 volunteers, but eventually include thousands of volunteers.

The clinical trials have three phases. The trials are looking for the answer to important questions such as Is the vaccine safe? What dose (amount) works best? How does the immune system react to it? How effective is it?

During the process, the FDA works closely with the company who makes the vaccine to evaluate the vaccine's safety and effectiveness. If the vaccine is found to be safe and effective, it will be approved and licensed by the FDA.

After a vaccine is licensed, experts may consider adding it to the recommended vaccine, or immunization, schedule. This schedule is from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It lists which vaccines are recommended for different groups of people. They list which age groups should get which vaccines, how many doses they need, and when they should get them.

Testing and monitoring continue after the vaccine is approved:

The company making the vaccines tests every batch of vaccines for quality and safety. The FDA reviews the results of these tests. It also inspects the factories where the vaccine is made. These checks help make sure the vaccines meet standards for quality and safety.

The FDA, CDC, and other federal agencies continue to monitor its safety, to watch for possible side effects. They have systems to track any safety issues with the vaccines.

These high safety standards and testing help to make sure that vaccines in the United States are safe. Vaccines help protect against serious, even deadly, diseases. They not only protect you, but also help to keep these diseases from spreading to others.",medlineplus.gov

It causes a rash and fever.

It is very contagious.

In rare cases, it can be deadly.

What are the symptoms of measles?

Measles starts with a fever that can get very high. Some of the other symptoms that may occur are:

Cough, runny nose, and red eyes

Rash of tiny, red spots that start at the head and spread to the rest of the body

Diarrhea

Ear infection

Is measles serious?

Measles can be dangerous, especially for babies and young children.

For some children, measles can lead to:

Pneumonia (a serious lung infection)

Lifelong brain damage

Deafness

Death

How does measles spread?

Measles spreads when a person infected with the measles virus breathes, coughs, or sneezes.

It is very contagious.

You can catch measles just by being in a room where a person with measles has been, up to 2 hours after that person is gone.

And you can catch measles from an infected person even before they have a measles rash.

alert icon Almost everyone who has not had the MMR shot will get measles if they are exposed to the measles virus.

Is measles in the United States?

Every year, unvaccinated U.S. residents get measles while they are abroad and bring the disease into the United States and spread it to others.

Measles is common in other parts of the world, including countries in Europe, Asia, the Pacific Islands, and Africa. When people with measles travel into the United States, they can spread the disease to unvaccinated people including children too young to be vaccinated.

How many measles cases are there in the United States each year?

From year to year, measles cases can range from roughly less than 100 to a couple hundred.

However, in some years, there were more measles cases than usual. In 2019, 1282 people from 31 states were reported as having measles. These measles outbreaks are a key reminder of how quickly diseases can spread when children aren’t vaccinated. Most of these people got measles in the United States after being exposed to someone who got measles while in another country.",www.cdc.gov

A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial.

Next, you will drink the xylose solution.

You will be asked to rest quietly.

Your provider will give you another blood test two hours later. For children, it may be one hour later.

What is polio?

Polio, or poliomyelitis, is a disabling and life-threatening disease caused by the poliovirus. The virus can infect a person’s spinal cord, causing paralysis (can’t move parts of the body). Paralysis caused by poliovirus occurs when the virus replicates in and attacks the nervous system. The paralysis can be lifelong, and it can be deadly.

It most often sickens children younger than 5 years old.

What are the symptoms of polio infection?

Most people who get infected with poliovirus do not have any symptoms. Some people (25 people out of 100) will have flu-like symptoms. These symptoms usually last 2 to 5 days.

In rare cases, poliovirus infection can be very serious. About 1 out of 200 people will have weakness or paralysis in their arms, legs, or both. This paralysis or weakness can last a lifetime.

Is it serious?

The risk of lifelong paralysis is very serious. Even children who seem to fully recover can develop new muscle pain, weakness, or paralysis as adults, 15 to 40 years later.

About 2 to 10 children out of 100 who have paralysis from polio die because the virus affects the muscles that help them breathe.

How does polio spread?

Poliovirus is very contagious. It spreads through contact with:

the stool (poop) of an infected person.

droplets from a sneeze or cough of an infected person.

If you get stool or droplets from an infected person on your hands and you touch your mouth, you can get infected. Also, if your child puts objects, like toys, that have stool or droplets on them into their mouth, they can get infected.

An infected person may spread the virus to others immediately before and up to 2 weeks after symptoms appear.

The virus may live in an infected person’s stool for many weeks. He or she can contaminate food and water when they touch it with unwashed hands.

People who don’t have symptoms can still pass the virus to others and make them sick.

Do people still get polio in the United States?

No, thanks to a successful vaccination program, the United States has been polio-free for more than 30 years, but the disease still occurs in other parts of the world. It would only take one person with polio traveling from another country to bring polio back to the United States.",www.cdc.gov

Side effects are rare, usually mild, and may include fussiness, diarrhea, and vomiting.

Some studies have shown a small rise in cases of intussusception within a week after the first or second dose of rotavirus vaccine. Intussusception is a type of bowel blockage that is treated in a hospital. Some babies might need surgery. Studies estimate a risk ranging from about 1 intussusception case in every 20,000 infants to 1 intussusception case in every 100,000 infants after vaccination.

What is rotavirus?

Rotavirus causes severe diarrhea and vomiting. It affects mostly babies and young children. Diarrhea and vomiting can lead to serious dehydration (loss of body fluid). If dehydration is not treated, it can be deadly.

What are the symptoms of rotavirus?

Rotavirus symptoms include:

Fever

Watery diarrhea

Vomiting

Stomach pain

Diarrhea and vomiting can last for three to eight days. Children may stop eating and drinking while they are sick.

Is rotavirus serious?

Rotavirus can be very harmful. Diarrhea, vomiting, and fever can cause a loss of body fluids. This leads to dehydration, which can be very dangerous, especially for babies and young children. Some children need an IV (needle in their vein) in the hospital to replace lost fluids.

How does rotavirus spread?

Rotavirus commonly spreads in families, hospitals, and childcare centers.

People who are infected with rotavirus shed the virus in their poop. If you get rotavirus particles in your mouth, you can get sick. This can happen if you

Touch contaminated objects or surfaces and then put your fingers in your mouth

Put your unwashed hands that are contaminated with poop into your mouth

287,Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR TB),"Fact Sheet

(PDFpdf icon – 37k)

Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR TB)

What is tuberculosis (TB)?

Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease caused by bacteria that are spread from person to person through the air. TB usually affects the lungs, but it can also affect other parts of the body, such as the brain, the kidneys, or the spine. In most cases, TB is treatable and curable; however, persons with TB can die if they do not get proper treatment.

What is multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB)?

Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR TB) is caused by an organism that is resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampin, the two most potent TB drugs. These drugs are used to treat all persons with TB disease.

What is extensively drug resistant tuberculosis (XDR TB)?

Extensively drug resistant TB (XDR TB) is a rare type of MDR TB that is resistant to isoniazid and rifampin, plus any fluoroquinolone and at least one of three injectable second-line drugs (i.e., amikacin, kanamycin, or capreomycin).

Because XDR TB is resistant to the most potent TB drugs, patients are left with treatment options that are much less effective.

XDR TB is of special concern for persons with HIV infection or other conditions that can weaken the immune system. These persons are more likely to develop TB disease once they are infected, and also have a higher risk of death once they develop TB.

How is TB spread?

Drug-susceptible TB and drug-resistant TB are spread the same way. TB bacteria are put into the air when a person with TB disease of the lungs or throat coughs, sneezes, speaks, or sings. These bacteria can float in the air for several hours, depending on the environment. Persons who breathe in the air containing these TB bacteria can become infected.

TB is not spread by

Shaking someone’s hand

Sharing food or drink

Touching bed linens or toilet seats

Sharing toothbrushes

Kissing

How does drug resistance happen?

Resistance to anti-TB drugs can occur when these drugs are misused or mismanaged. Examples include when patients do not complete their full course of treatment; when health-care providers prescribe the wrong treatment, the wrong dose, or length of time for taking the drugs; when the supply of drugs is not always available; or when the drugs are of poor quality.

Who is at risk for getting MDR TB?

Drug resistance is more common in people who:

Do not take their TB medicine regularly

Do not take all of their TB medicine as told by their doctor or nurse

Develop TB disease again, after having taken TB medicine in the past

Come from areas of the world where drug-resistant TB is common

Have spent time with someone known to have drug-resistant TB disease

How can MDR TB be prevented?

The most important thing a person can do to prevent the spread of MDR TB is to take all of their medications exactly as prescribed by their health care provider. No doses should be missed and treatment should not be stopped early. Patients should tell their health care provider if they are having trouble taking the medications. If patients plan to travel, they should talk to their health care providers and make sure they have enough medicine to last while away.

Health care providers can help prevent MDR TB by quickly diagnosing cases, following recommended treatment guidelines, monitoring patients’ response to treatment, and making sure therapy is completed.

Another way to prevent getting MDR TB is to avoid exposure to known MDR TB patients in closed or crowded places such as hospitals, prisons, or homeless shelters. If you work in hospitals or health-care settings where TB patients are likely to be seen, you should consult infection control or occupational health experts. Ask about administrative and environmental procedures for preventing exposure to TB. Once those procedures are implemented, additional measures could include using personal respiratory protective devices.

Is there a vaccine to prevent TB?

Yes, there is a vaccine for TB disease called Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG). It is used in some countries to prevent severe forms of TB in children. However, BCG is not generally recommended in the United States because it has limited effectiveness for preventing TB overall.

What should I do if I think I have been exposed to someone with TB disease?

If you think you have been exposed to someone with TB disease, you should contact your doctor or local health department about getting a TB skin test or TB blood test. And tell the doctor or nurse when you spent time with this person.

What are the symptoms of TB disease?

The general symptoms of TB disease include feelings of sickness or weakness, weight loss, fever, and night sweats. The symptoms of TB disease of the lungs may also include coughing, chest pain, and coughing up blood. Symptoms of TB disease in other parts of the body depend on the area affected. If you have these symptoms, you should contact your doctor or local health department.

290,Study of Mosquito Protein Could Lead to Treatments Against Life Threatening Viruses,"Study of mosquito protein could lead to treatments against life-threatening viruses

NIAID

The mosquito protein AEG12 strongly inhibits the family of viruses that cause yellow fever, dengue, West Nile, and Zika and weakly inhibits coronaviruses, according to scientists at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and their collaborators. The researchers found that AEG12 works by destabilizing the viral envelope, breaking its protective covering. Although the protein does not affect viruses that do not have an envelope, such as those that cause pink eye and bladder infections, the findings could lead to therapeutics against viruses that affect millions of people around the world. The research was published online in PNAS.

Scientists at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), part of NIH, used X-ray crystallography to solve the structure of AEG12. Senior author Geoffrey Mueller, Ph.D., head of the NIEHS Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Group, said at the molecular level, AEG12 rips out the lipids, or the fat-like portions of the membrane that hold the virus together.

""It is as if AEG12 is hungry for the lipids that are in the virus membrane, so it gets rid of some of the lipids it has and exchanges them for the ones it really prefers,"" Mueller said. ""The protein has high affinity for viral lipids and steals them from the virus.""

As a result, Mueller says the AEG12 protein has great killing power over some viruses. While the researchers demonstrated that AEG12 was most effective against flaviviruses, the family of viruses to which Zika, West Nile, and others belong, it is possible AEG12 could be effective against SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. But, Mueller said it will take years of bioengineering to make AEG12 a viable therapy for COVID-19. Part of the problem is AEG12 also breaks opens red blood cells, so researchers will have to identify compounds that will make the protein target viruses only.

Alexander Foo, Ph.D., an NIEHS visiting fellow and lead author of the paper, explained that mosquitoes produce AEG12 when they take a blood meal or become infected with flaviviruses. Like humans, mosquitoes mount a vigorous immune response against these viruses, with AEG12 bursting their viral covering. But, at the beginning of the project, Foo and his colleagues knew little about the function of AEG12.

""The prospect of studying a new protein is exciting, yet daunting,"" Foo said. ""Thankfully, we had enough clues and access to a wide range of expertise at NIEHS to piece it together.""

Co-author and crystallography expert Lars Pedersen, Ph.D., is leader of the NIEHS Structure Function Group. He routinely uses information about a molecule’s physical makeup in his work and encourages more scientists to consider using this data in their studies. He said, ""Our research shows that understanding the structure of a protein can be important in figuring out what it does and how it could help treat disease.""

291,Study of Mosquito Protein Could Lead to Treatments Against Life Threatening Viruses,"Study of mosquito protein could lead to treatments against life-threatening viruses

NIAID

The mosquito protein AEG12 strongly inhibits the family of viruses that cause yellow fever, dengue, West Nile, and Zika and weakly inhibits coronaviruses, according to scientists at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and their collaborators. The researchers found that AEG12 works by destabilizing the viral envelope, breaking its protective covering. Although the protein does not affect viruses that do not have an envelope, such as those that cause pink eye and bladder infections, the findings could lead to therapeutics against viruses that affect millions of people around the world. The research was published online in PNAS.

Scientists at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), part of NIH, used X-ray crystallography to solve the structure of AEG12. Senior author Geoffrey Mueller, Ph.D., head of the NIEHS Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Group, said at the molecular level, AEG12 rips out the lipids, or the fat-like portions of the membrane that hold the virus together.

""It is as if AEG12 is hungry for the lipids that are in the virus membrane, so it gets rid of some of the lipids it has and exchanges them for the ones it really prefers,"" Mueller said. ""The protein has high affinity for viral lipids and steals them from the virus.""

As a result, Mueller says the AEG12 protein has great killing power over some viruses. While the researchers demonstrated that AEG12 was most effective against flaviviruses, the family of viruses to which Zika, West Nile, and others belong, it is possible AEG12 could be effective against SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. But, Mueller said it will take years of bioengineering to make AEG12 a viable therapy for COVID-19. Part of the problem is AEG12 also breaks opens red blood cells, so researchers will have to identify compounds that will make the protein target viruses only.

Alexander Foo, Ph.D., an NIEHS visiting fellow and lead author of the paper, explained that mosquitoes produce AEG12 when they take a blood meal or become infected with flaviviruses. Like humans, mosquitoes mount a vigorous immune response against these viruses, with AEG12 bursting their viral covering. But, at the beginning of the project, Foo and his colleagues knew little about the function of AEG12.

""The prospect of studying a new protein is exciting, yet daunting,"" Foo said. ""Thankfully, we had enough clues and access to a wide range of expertise at NIEHS to piece it together.""

Co-author and crystallography expert Lars Pedersen, Ph.D., is leader of the NIEHS Structure Function Group. He routinely uses information about a molecule’s physical makeup in his work and encourages more scientists to consider using this data in their studies. He said, ""Our research shows that understanding the structure of a protein can be important in figuring out what it does and how it could help treat disease.""

What

A collaborative study conducted by scientists from the National Institutes of Health, Department of Defense (DOD), and multiple academic institutions has identified blood biomarkers that could help to predict which athletes need additional time to recover from a sports related concussion. This collaboration, known as the Concussion Assessment, Research, and Education (CARE) consortium, is supported, in part, by DOD and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).

In this study, conducted at several sites across the U.S., 127 male and female collegiate athletes who had sustained a sports-related concussion were tested at several time points: shortly after injury, when their symptoms resolved, and one week after returning to play. Each athlete had also undergone preseason, baseline testing.

Using an ultrasensitive assay that can detect minute amounts of protein, the researchers tested blood serum from these athletes and identified two blood proteins that were associated with the length of time needed by the athletes to return to play. Amounts of these two proteins, tau protein and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were found to be significantly different in athletes who needed less or more than 14 days to return. While further research is needed, the results of this study are an important step towards the development of a test that could help predict which athletes need more time to recover from a concussion and resume activity.

296,"Blood-based Biomarker Can Detect, Predict Severity of Traumatic Brain Injury","Blood-based biomarker can detect, predict severity of traumatic brain injury

NIH Clinical Center

A study from the National Institutes of Health confirms that neurofilament light chain as a blood biomarker can detect brain injury and predict recovery in multiple groups, including professional hockey players with acute or chronic concussions and clinic-based patients with mild, moderate, or severe traumatic brain injury. The research was conducted by scientists at the NIH Clinical Center, Bethesda, Maryland, and published in the July 8, 2020, online issue of Neurology.

After a traumatic brain injury, neurofilament light chain breaks away from neurons in the brain and collects in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The scientists confirmed that neurofilament light chain also collects in the blood in levels that correlate closely with the levels in the CSF. They demonstrated that neurofilament light chain in the blood can detect brain injury and predict recovery across all stages of traumatic brain injury.

“Currently, there are no validated blood-based biomarkers to provide an objective diagnosis of mild traumatic brain injury or to predict recovery,” said Leighton Chan, M.D., M.P.H., chief of the Rehabilitation Medicine Department at the NIH Clinical Center. “Our study reinforces the need and a way forward for a non-invasive test of neurofilament light chain to aid in the diagnosis of patients and athletes whose brain injuries are often unrecognized, undiagnosed or underreported. “

The study examined multiple groups including professional hockey players in Sweden with sports-related concussions, hockey players without concussions, hockey players with persistent post-concussion symptoms, non-athlete controls, and clinic-based patients at the NIH Clinical Center who were healthy or with acute, subacute, and chronic mild traumatic brain injuries. The study showed that neurofilament light chain in the blood:

Correlated closely with CSF neurofilament light chain in hockey players with concussions and non-athlete healthy controls, suggesting that blood neurofilament light chain could be used instead of CSF neurofilament light chain.

Demonstrated strong diagnostic ability for sports-related concussions, where it could identify hockey players with concussions from hockey players without concussions and could identify clinic-based patients with mild, moderate, and severe traumatic brain injuries from each other and controls. This is significant as there is an unmet need for an easy and accessible blood biomarker to determine at the time of injury or in the chronic phase if a person has a concussion or signs of a traumatic brain injury.

Could distinguish with high accuracy hockey players who could return to play after 10 days from those who developed persistent post-concussion symptoms and eventually retired from the game. In the clinic-based cohort, patients with worse functional outcomes had higher blood neurofilament light chain levels. This is significant as there is an unmet need for a blood biomarker that can help clinicians to determine when athletes can safely return to play or when patients can return to work or resume daily activities.

In the clinic-based patients, the levels of blood neurofilament light chain at five years after a single mild, moderate, or severe traumatic brain injury were significantly increased compared to healthy controls. This suggests that even a single mild traumatic brain injury (without visible signs of structural damage on a standard clinical MRI) may cause long-term brain injury, and serum neurofilament light could be a sensitive biomarker to detect even that far out from initial injury.

“This study is the first to do a detailed assessment of serum neurofilament light chain and advanced brain imaging in multiple cohorts, brain injury severities, and time points after injury,” said the study’s lead author, Pashtun Shahim, M.D., Ph.D., NIH Clinical Center. “Our results suggest that serum neurofilament light chain may provide a valuable compliment to imaging by detecting underlying neuronal damage which may be responsible for the long-term symptoms experienced by a significant number of athletes with acute concussions, and patients with more severe brain injuries.”

The study was funded by the Intramural Research Program at NIH, the Department of Defense Center for Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine at the Uniformed Services University, and the Swedish Research Council.

Traumatic brain injury is a major leading cause of death and disability in the United States with more than 2.87 million emergency department visits, hospitalizations and deaths annually. While majority of all traumatic brain injuries are classified as mild (also known as a concussion), it remains difficult to diagnose this condition. There are a wide range of variable behavioral and observational tests to help determine a patient’s injuries but most of these tests rely on the patient to self-report signs and symptoms. Also, imaging has limitations with detecting micro-structural injuries in the brain.

302,How to Cope with the Stress of Social Isolation,"Social isolation, or being physically separated from others, can lead to loneliness and increased stress, especially during a pandemic.

Loneliness has been associated with higher rates of depression, anxiety, and suicide. It can also weaken our immune systems, which helps protect us from getting sick. Luckily, understanding stress and loneliness and how to manage them can help.

How stress affects us

While some stress is normal, too much of it can interfere with daily activities, relationships, and work. Symptoms of stress and anxiety include:

Feeling irritable, restless, and on edge

Feeling overwhelmed and unmotivated

Muscle tension

Fatigue or tiredness

Difficulty concentrating

Combating stress

To combat stress, make sure to eat a diet full of heart-healthy fruits, vegetables, and grains. Get enough sleep (for adults, that is usually between 7 and 8 hours) and seek out physical activity.

Connecting with nature can lower levels of stress and reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression. A walk or bike ride may make you feel better and stay physically fit. Just 30 minutes of physical activity a day can make a big difference. Remember to wear a mask even when you are outside. Also, keep 6 feet of space between yourself and people who do not live in your home.

Combating loneliness

Avoiding in-person social gatherings will help keep you and others safe. But you can stay in touch with people in other ways:

Connect with loved ones through online games, video calls, or messaging apps.

Look online for virtual exercise classes, religious services, and cultural events.

Try at-home, guided yoga, mindfulness, or meditation through a mobile app.

Consider adopting a pet. Pets can provide comfort and lower blood pressure, according to the National Institute on Aging.

Reach out to a health care professional

Stress and social isolation can worsen existing mental illness. Consult your health care provider if your feelings are getting in the way of your daily life.

""For those with mental illnesses, be sure to continue your treatment regimens,"" says Joshua Gordon, M.D., Ph.D., director of the National Institute of Mental Health. ""Consider developing a plan for telehealth sessions with your provider if you (or your provider) are quarantined or must avoid exposures to the public for any reason. And reach out to friends and family for support, virtually if necessary.""",magazine.medlineplus.gov

Larger text size Large text size Regular text size

Print

Parents do everything they can to protect their children. But sadly, many kids have gone through trauma.

A trauma is any event that is deeply upsetting, scary, or harmful. Things like abuse, violence, accidents, or natural disasters can be traumas. Becoming homeless, losing a parent, or a serious illness can be traumas too.

Traumas are serious events that cause kids to fear for their life or safety.

After a trauma, the emotional effects can last a long time. It can be hard to move on. For some kids, trauma can lead to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

But kids can recover after trauma. There is therapy that can help. Kids also need extra support and comfort from parents.

How Does Trauma Affect Kids?

Trauma affects a child's sense of safety and trust. After a trauma, kids can still feel tense or scared. Some feel alone, sad, angry, or guilty. They may think they are to blame for what happened to them. For some kids, there's a loss of self-esteem or dignity. For some, there's deep grief.

Trauma also can affect a child's mood, behavior, or sleep. Some kids become depressed. They might act grumpy or seem sad. Some get in trouble more often or do worse in school. Some have new fears or trouble sleeping. Some have upsetting memories, called flashbacks. Often, kids avoid things that remind them of what they've been through.

After a trauma, some kids share how they feel. But other kids keep things to themselves. They may try to hide how they feel, or try to push it out of their minds. They may think others expect them to ""get over it."" Some just don't have words for their feelings. For any of these reasons, a parent might not know what their child is going through.

How Does Therapy Help Kids Heal After a Trauma?

Therapy gives kids a way to safely share their feelings, tell their story, and get support. In therapy, kids learn to talk about what they've been through. They learn coping and calming skills. They learn to adjust the way they think and feel about the trauma. Slowly, they learn to face things they used to avoid. Therapy helps kids find their own courage and gain confidence.

Child therapy for trauma is called trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (or TF-CBT). Therapy includes talk, play, and learning activities that heal trauma.

TF-CBT helps parents too. It's natural for parents to feel upset about what their child has been through. In therapy, parents get the support they need. They get advice on how to help their child at home.

In TF-CBT, parents can play a big role in their child's healing. They are coached to listen in ways that help their child open up, talk, and feel close. They help their child practice coping skills at home. They share in the good feelings as their child makes progress.

How Can I Find Therapy for My Child?

Talk to your child's doctor. Let them know what your child has been through. The doctor cares about your child's mental health too.

Ask the doctor to refer you to a trained child therapist who can help. You might need to take your child to therapy once a week for a few months. But you'll see progress along the way.

How Can I Give My Child the Extra Support They Need?

After a trauma, kids need your support and comfort more than ever. Be sure to:

Spend time with your child. Do things that are soothing, relaxing, or fun. Cook together, take a walk, play, read, make art, or sing. Try to do this every day, even if it's only for a few minutes.

Do things that are soothing, relaxing, or fun. Cook together, take a walk, play, read, make art, or sing. Try to do this every day, even if it's only for a few minutes. Parent with patience and warmth. Use kind words. Give praise when your child is doing well or trying hard. Let your child know you're proud of them. Be patient when they make a mistake. Show them how to try again.

Use kind words. Give praise when your child is doing well or trying hard. Let your child know you're proud of them. Be patient when they make a mistake. Show them how to try again. Show love.

Use hugs, smiles, words, and caring actions to show your love. Use soothing words and offer comfort when your child is upset. Have soothing routines. Take a few minutes at bedtime (or any time) to read a story, snuggle together, or sing to your young child. For older kids, make it a routine to give a good night hug, along with a few minutes to talk, listen, or laugh together.

305,How to Cope with the Stress of Social Isolation,"Social isolation, or being physically separated from others, can lead to loneliness and increased stress, especially during a pandemic.

Loneliness has been associated with higher rates of depression, anxiety, and suicide. It can also weaken our immune systems, which helps protect us from getting sick. Luckily, understanding stress and loneliness and how to manage them can help.

How stress affects us

While some stress is normal, too much of it can interfere with daily activities, relationships, and work. Symptoms of stress and anxiety include:

Feeling irritable, restless, and on edge

Feeling overwhelmed and unmotivated

Muscle tension

Fatigue or tiredness

Difficulty concentrating

Combating stress

To combat stress, make sure to eat a diet full of heart-healthy fruits, vegetables, and grains. Get enough sleep (for adults, that is usually between 7 and 8 hours) and seek out physical activity.

Connecting with nature can lower levels of stress and reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression. A walk or bike ride may make you feel better and stay physically fit. Just 30 minutes of physical activity a day can make a big difference. Remember to wear a mask even when you are outside. Also, keep 6 feet of space between yourself and people who do not live in your home.

Combating loneliness

Avoiding in-person social gatherings will help keep you and others safe. But you can stay in touch with people in other ways:

Connect with loved ones through online games, video calls, or messaging apps.

Look online for virtual exercise classes, religious services, and cultural events.

Try at-home, guided yoga, mindfulness, or meditation through a mobile app.

Consider adopting a pet. Pets can provide comfort and lower blood pressure, according to the National Institute on Aging.

Reach out to a health care professional

Stress and social isolation can worsen existing mental illness. Consult your health care provider if your feelings are getting in the way of your daily life.

""For those with mental illnesses, be sure to continue your treatment regimens,"" says Joshua Gordon, M.D., Ph.D., director of the National Institute of Mental Health. ""Consider developing a plan for telehealth sessions with your provider if you (or your provider) are quarantined or must avoid exposures to the public for any reason. And reach out to friends and family for support, virtually if necessary.""",magazine.medlineplus.gov

A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial.

Next, you will drink the xylose solution.

You will be asked to rest quietly.

Your provider will give you another blood test two hours later. For children, it may be one hour later.

310,Pregnancy Check-Ups: Healthy Start for Mom and Baby,"Pregnancy Check-Ups

Healthy Start for Mom and Baby

Life is busy before a baby arrives. There are many things to do to prepare. One of the most important is to visit your health care provider regularly.

Check-ups before your baby is born are called prenatal visits. They help make sure you and your baby are healthy. Your health care provider will look for certain problems that can happen during pregnancy. Some issues are best treated early. Others can be prevented before they start.

“Prenatal care is fundamental for shaping the lives of women and their children,” says Dr. Monica Longo, an NIH expert on prenatal health. Longo cares for women with high-risk pregnancies. Such women have a higher chance of complications.

If you think you may be pregnant, schedule a visit with your provider. If you’re pregnant, you’ll need to start regular prenatal visits. Most women have check-ups about once a month in the beginning. Then, they go more often later in the pregnancy.

During a prenatal visit, your provider will ask about your health history. They will also perform a physical exam and weight check. They’ll let you know how much weight gain is healthy for your body and help track your progress.

You’ll also be asked to provide a urine sample. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common during pregnancy. UTIs and other infections increase the risk of having a preterm birth. This is when you give birth at 37 weeks or earlier.

“One of the primary purposes of prenatal care is actually prevention,” says Longo. “We screen women to find potential health problems before those issues can worsen.”

During certain stages of pregnancy, your provider will perform blood tests and imaging tests. These include ultrasound exams to look at the baby’s growth and development. Visits are also an opportunity to talk with your provider about how to give your baby a healthy start.

“During prenatal visits, we educ-ate and counsel moms about healthy habits, healthy food choices, and exercise,” Longo says. “We also address any concerns a new mom-to-be might have.”

Taking a prenatal vitamin is also key. Folic acid is included in most prenatal vitamins. It reduces the risk of severe birth defects that affect the developing brain and spine.

It’s important to stay away from things that could harm your baby. These include certain medications, smoking, and alcoholic drinks. Also, talk with your provider about any health conditions. Conditions like diabetes (a disease that causes high blood sugar) and high blood pressure need to be brought under control.

Some women choose to talk with their provider before becoming pregnant. This is called a preconception visit. It can help you plan for a safer pregnancy.

Early and regular care for you and your developing baby is important. Studies show that prenatal care reduces the risk of having a low-birth weight baby. Low birth weight can cause health problems. Even during the pandemic, it’s essential to keep up with regular prenatal care.

“Providers around the globe have adapted prenatal care to fit the current challenges,” says Longo. That means using telehealth for visits that don’t have to be done in person.

Health care providers are also seeing fewer patients and extending the time between them. This reduces possible exposure in waiting rooms.

“Providers are prepared for these difficult times,” says Longo. So it’s crucial that moms-to-be keep up with prenatal care.",newsinhealth.nih.gov

316,Biomarkers Identified in Collegiate Athletes That Could Help Predict Time Needed to Recover From Concussion,"Biomarkers identified in collegiate athletes that could help predict time needed to recover from concussion

What

A collaborative study conducted by scientists from the National Institutes of Health, Department of Defense (DOD), and multiple academic institutions has identified blood biomarkers that could help to predict which athletes need additional time to recover from a sports related concussion. This collaboration, known as the Concussion Assessment, Research, and Education (CARE) consortium, is supported, in part, by DOD and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).

In this study, conducted at several sites across the U.S., 127 male and female collegiate athletes who had sustained a sports-related concussion were tested at several time points: shortly after injury, when their symptoms resolved, and one week after returning to play. Each athlete had also undergone preseason, baseline testing.

Using an ultrasensitive assay that can detect minute amounts of protein, the researchers tested blood serum from these athletes and identified two blood proteins that were associated with the length of time needed by the athletes to return to play. Amounts of these two proteins, tau protein and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were found to be significantly different in athletes who needed less or more than 14 days to return. While further research is needed, the results of this study are an important step towards the development of a test that could help predict which athletes need more time to recover from a concussion and resume activity.

This study was published in JAMA Network Open.

320,What Can Parents Do about Heavy Metals in Baby Food?,"

Larger text size Large text size Regular text size

I've heard about heavy metals in baby food. How can I keep my baby safe?

- Keeley

Heavy metals are found in soil, water, and the air we breathe. Plants take up these metals as they grow and can end up in the food we eat. Our bodies need some heavy metals (like iron and zinc) to work well, but other heavy metals (like arsenic and lead) are harmful. Some crops, like rice, absorb more of these harmful metals than others. Heavy metals can build up in the body over time and cause problems with learning, behavior, and attention.

When making baby food, companies add vitamins and minerals along with food additives that may contain heavy metals. Some baby foods have higher levels of heavy metals than others, including:

infant rice cereal

infant rice puff snacks

teething biscuits and rice rusks

fruit juice

carrots and sweet potatoes

Even organic baby food can have heavy metals in it.

The amount of heavy metals is low in baby foods, but you can take steps to lower it even more. Here are ways to do that:",kidshealth.org

322,What is Malnutrition?,"Malnutrition is a common and detrimental condition that must be addressed quickly and comprehensively. Registered dietitian nutritionists are working hard to improve the speed and accuracy of malnutrition diagnosis and nutrition interventions in health care. Malnutrition is a physical state of unbalanced nutrition. It can mean undernutrition or overnutrition. When most people think of malnutrition, they usually picture undernutrition, which can be caused by a lack of calories, protein or other nutrients. This occurs frequently in areas of the world without adequate access to food and clean drinking water.

Overnutrition comes from eating too many calories. Someone can eat more calories than their body needs and be malnourished at the same time. They may not be eating enough nutritious foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, beans, low-fat dairy, nuts and seeds. This can result in vitamin, mineral or protein deficiencies. In the United States, this more commonly occurs in food insecure, impoverished areas.

Malnutrition in children, especially young children, can lead to stunted growth, developmental delays and more sickness due to poor immune function.

Clinical malnutrition is when a hospital patient becomes malnourished. There are many reasons why someone in the hospital may not be getting enough nutrition. For example, their body requires more nutrition than usual, or they are not able to absorb the nutrients they eat. Some hospital patients need to receive nutrition through a tube inserted into their stomach or even intravenous nutrition, where the digestive tract is bypassed altogether.

It is important that malnutrition is diagnosed in a timely manner. When a hospital patient becomes malnourished their medical treatment and recovery are affected. Research shows that malnutrition increases the risk of death, length of stay and health care costs. Hospitals are required to screen for malnutrition within 24 hours of patient admission.

Registered dietitian nutritionists make recommendations and work with the health care team to help patients receive the nutrition they need. RDNs assess malnutrition using weight history, dietary intake, lab values and a physical exam. A nutrition-focused physical exam involves checking for body fat and muscle loss, fluid accumulation and hand grip strength. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services requires long-term care facilities to employ registered dietitian nutritionists to manage the nutrition care of residents.

Malnutrition also can be the result of an eating disorder, organ failure or severe infection or physical trauma such as a head injury. Malnutrition frequently occurs in the older adult population, especially in those with dementia or Alzheimer’s disease. Tooth loss and other dental issues, loss of appetite and functional decline are contributing factors to malnutrition among older adults.",www.eatright.org
323,Healthy Food Choices for Your Family,"Page Content

​How can you ensure that your child is well nourished?

Here are some tips to keep in mind when planning and preparing meals for your family.

Variety

Your child should consume a variety of foods from the five major food groups. Each food group supplies important nutrients, including vitamins and minerals.



The five food groups and typical minimum servings:

Vegetables: 3-5 servings per day. A serving may consist of 1 cup of raw leafy vegetables, 3/4 cup of vegetable juice, or 1/2 cup of other vegetables, chopped raw or cooked.

Fruits: 2-4 servings per day. A serving may consist of 1/2 cup of sliced fruit, 3/4 cup of fruit juice, or a medium-size whole fruit, like an apple, banana, or pear.

Bread, cereal, or pasta: 6-11 servings per day. Each serving should equal 1 slice of bread, 1/2 cup of rice or pasta, or 1 ounce of cereal.

Protein foods: 2-3 servings of 2-3 ounces of cooked lean meat, poultry, or fish per day. A serving in this group may also consist of 1/2 cup of cooked dry beans, one egg, or 2 tablespoons of peanut butter for each ounce of lean meat.

Dairy products: 2-3 servings per day of 1 cup of low-fat milk or yogurt, or 1 1/2 ounces of natural cheese.

Fiber​

Fiber is a carbohydrate component of plant foods that is usually un-digestible. It is found in foods like fruits, vegetables, whole-grain breads, cereals, brown rice, beans, seeds, and nuts.

In adults: Increased fiber has been linked with a reduction of chronic gastrointestinal problems, including colon cancer, irritable bowel syndrome, and diverticulitis.

In children: Fiber's only proven benefit is its ability to ease constipation—providing bulk that can promote regular bowel movements, soften the stools, and decrease the time it takes food to travel through the intestines. But since food preferences and eating habits often get searly in life, and since high-fiber foods contain other nutrients, parents should include these foods in children's daily diets. See Kids Need Fiber: Here's Why and How.

Protein

Your child needs protein so their body can grow and function properly. This includes building new tissues and producing antibodies that help fight infections. Without essential amino acids (the building blocks of protein), children would be much more susceptible to serious diseases.

Protein-rich plants—such as dried beans and peas (legumes), grains, seeds, and nuts—can be used as valuable sources of protein. Other protein-rich foods include meat, fish, milk, yogurt, cheese, and eggs. These animal products contain high-quality protein and a full array of amino acids.

Keep in mind, however, that while red meat and shellfish are rich in protein and an important source of iron, they can also be high in fat and cholesterol as well. So, your child should consume them only in moderate amounts. Select lean cuts of meat and trim the fat before cooking. Likewise, remove skin from poultry before serving.

Fat

Humans cannot live without fats. They are a concentrated source of energy, providing essential fatty acids that are needed for a variety of bodily processes (metabolism, blood clotting, and vitamin absorption).

However, high fat intake—particularly a diet high in saturated fats—can cause problems. Saturated fats are usually solid at room temperatures and are found in fatty meats (such as beef, pork, ham, veal, and lamb) and many dairy products (whole milk, cheese, and ice cream). They can contribute to the buildup of plague in blood vessels and lead to heart disease later in life. A diet rich in saturated fats also can increase blood cholesterol, particularly in people who have inherited a tendency toward high cholesterol levels.

After age two: Children should be served foods that are lower in fat and saturated fats. Chances are that your child's favorite foods are higher in fat than is desirable. Healthy ating means relying more on low-fat, low-cholesterol foods like poultry, fish, and lean meat (broiled, baked, or roasted; not fried), soft margarine (instead of butter), low-fat dairy products, and low-saturated-fat oils from vegetables, while limiting egg consumption.

As a general guideline, fats should make up less than 30% of the calories in your child's diet. No more than about 1/3 or less of those fat calories should come from from saturated fat, with the rest coming from unsaturated (that is, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated) fats. These healthier fats are liquid at room temperature and include vegetable oils like corn, safflower, sunflower, soybean, and olive.

Some parents find the information about various types of fat confusing. In general, oils and fats that come from animals are saturated. The simplest place to start is just to reduce the amount of fatty foods of all types in your family's diet. See How to Reduce Fat and Cholesterol in Your Child's Diet.

Sugar

Limit the amount of sugar in your child's diet to to moderate levels. Sugar has plenty of calories, but dietitians often call them “empty calories"" because they have very little additional nutritional value. Even so, many children consume sugar in large amounts, usually at the expense of healthier foods. When children drink sodas, for example, they are usually leaving the milk in the refrigerator; when they eat a brownie, they may be overlooking the bowl of fruit, a good source of complex carbohydrates, on the kitchen table.

Salt

Table salt, or sodium chloride, may improve the taste of certain foods. However, researchers have found a relationship between salt in the diet and high blood pressure in some people.

High blood pres­sure afflicts about 25% of adult Americans ​​and contributes to heart attacks and strokes.

The habit of using extra salt is an learned one. So, as much as possible, serve your child foods low in salt. In the kitchen, minimize the amount of salt you add to food as you prepare it. Try using herbs, spices, or lemon juice instead. Take the salt shaker off the dinner table, or at least limit its use by your family.

Because salt acts a preservative, processed foods often contain large amounts of it. Salt-rich foods may include processed cheese, instant puddings, canned vegetables, canned soups, hot dogs, cottage cheese, salad dressings, pickles, and potato chips and other snacks.

Weaning is when a baby moves from breast milk to other sources of nourishment. Weaning your baby is a process that takes patience and understanding from both you and your child.

When Is the Right Time to Wean?

When to wean is a personal decision. A mom might be influenced by a return to work, her health or the baby's, or simply a feeling that the time is right.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends feeding babies only breast milk for the first 6 months of life. After that, the AAP recommends a combination of solid foods and breast milk until a baby is at least 1 year old. Then, babies may begin drinking whole cow's milk.

Most experts agree that breastfeeding should continue for as long as it suits mother and baby. Many women choose to wean after their baby's first birthday. At this age, babies are starting to walk, talk, and eat more solid foods. So they may naturally lose interest in nursing.

Other moms breastfeed longer than a year (this is called extended breastfeeding). Extended breastfeeding is a healthy and reasonable option for mothers and children who aren't ready to wean. In fact, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that moms breastfeed for the first 2 years of a child's life.

Weaning does not have to be all-or-nothing. Some women choose to wean during the day and breastfeed at night, depending on their work situation and their schedules.

Whenever you decide to wean, your child may have another time in mind. Some children wean themselves earlier than the mother intended and others resist weaning when the mother is ready. Those wean later in life tend to be more resistant. For example, a 2-year-old toddler may be more attached and less flexible about giving up breastfeeding than a 12-month-old baby. At times like these, it's important to take it slow and be sensitive to each other's needs.

Signs Your Baby May Be Weaning

Some kids are content to nurse indefinitely. But others will give moms clues that they're ready to begin the process of weaning, such as:

seeming disinterested or fussy when nursing

nursing in shorter sessions than before

being easily distracted while nursing

""playing"" at the breast, like constantly pulling on and off or biting. Babies who bite during nursing should immediately be taken off the breast and told, calmly but firmly, ""No biting. Biting hurts.""

nursing for comfort (sucking at the breast but not drawing out the milk)

Approaches to Weaning

To let both mom and baby adjust physically and emotionally to the change, weaning should be done over time.

One approach is to drop one feeding session a week until your child takes all the feeds from a bottle or cup. If you want to give your child pumped breast milk, you'll need to pump to keep up your milk supply. If you are weaning your child off breast milk, slowly dropping feeds can help avoid engorgement.

You might begin by stopping the midday feeding because it's usually the smallest and most inconvenient — especially for working moms. Many mothers let go of the bedtime feeding last because it's still a special part of bonding.

Some moms leave the decision of when to wean up to their child. Children who are eating three meals of solid food a day (plus snacks) often breastfeed less and less. In that case, a mom's milk will dry up from lack of demand and she'll need to pump to keep the milk flowing. If your child is breastfeeding less, make sure he or she is getting enough iron-fortified formula or milk. Check with the doctor about how much your child should get.

If your baby weans before 1 year of age, or you find that you're not making enough milk, you will need to give your baby formula. Check with the doctor to see what formula is right for your little one.

Making the Change Easier

Weaning is easier if a child has also taken milk from another source. So try giving an occasional bottle of breast milk to your little one after breastfeeding is well-established. Even if you continue breastfeeding, this can ease weaning later. It also lets other family members feed the baby and makes it possible to leave your child with a caregiver.

Remember that infants over 6 months should have solid foods as well as breast milk. After 1 year, breast milk alone does not provide all the nutrients a growing child needs. So solid foods must become a regular part of the diet.

As you start to wean, remember that your child needs time to adjust to drinking from cups. Be patient as your little one begins exploring the world of food.

Here are some more ways to make this change easier:

Engage your child in a fun play activity or an outing during times when you would usually nurse.

Avoid sitting in your usual nursing spots or wearing your usual nursing clothes.

Delay weaning if your child is trying to adapt to some other change. Trying to wean when your little one is just beginning childcare or during teething might not be a good idea.

If your baby is younger than 1 year, try to introduce a bottle or cup when you would typically be nursing. For an older child, try a healthy snack, offering a cup, or maybe a cuddle.

Try changing your daily routine so that you're otherwise engaged during breastfeeding times.

Enlist your partner's help to provide a distraction at a typical nursing time.

If your child picks up a comforting habit (such as thumbsucking) or becomes attached to a security blanket, don't discourage it. Your child might be trying to adjust to the emotional changes of weaning.

How You Might Feel

Many moms make the decision to wean with mixed emotions. Weaning brings more freedom and flexibility, and the proud realization that a child is reaching a milestone. But nursing is an intimate activity that fosters a strong bond between mother and child — and some women find it hard to let that go.

So expect a wide range of emotions, and understand that your child may have them too. Also remember that there will be countless other ways to nurture your child in the days ahead.",kidshealth.org
325,Comfort Care for Kids and Their Families: A Mother's Story,"When Jake Swoyer was born in 1995, he seemed like any other healthy baby boy. His family—parents, John and Barbara Swoyer, and big brother Ryan, then 3— were thrilled.

But when Jake, who is from Sudbury, Massachusetts, was 7 months old, he had his first seizure. After that, ""he got very sick, very quickly,"" his mother says. His seizures came frequently and could last up to an hour. ""We had 23 ambulance rides in that first year.""

""I had no idea what palliative care really was or what it could do for us."" – Barbara Swoyer

Despite a lot of testing, doctors were unable to determine a cause for his seizures until Jake was nearly 10 years old, when a test revealed he had a genetic mutation associated with Dravet syndrome. Dravet syndrome is a lifelong, rare form of epilepsy that begins in the first year of life and typically doesn't respond to medication. Jake was also later diagnosed with mitochondrial dysfunction, adding to the severity and complexity of his disease.

Since he was diagnosed, Jake has suffered a long, slow, steady decline in his health, his mother says. Palliative care has made all the difference in how the family has coped with Jake's devastating condition and in helping Jake enjoy a good quality of life. He received pediatric palliative care support and services until he turned 21.

Finding palliative care

""When Jake was first diagnosed, our physician suggested enrolling him in palliative care. Like many families, my first thought was, 'Oh no, he thinks my son is dying.' I had no idea what palliative care really was or what it could do for us,"" Barbara recalls.

She finally took his suggestion after about a year. As Barbara worked with several different providers, ""a light bulb finally went off. I realized what palliative care was supposed to be,"" she says. ""Along with providing clinical and emotional support, the palliative team introduced comfort care measures. Jake was able to receive pet therapy for enjoyment, massage therapy for relaxation, and music therapy for active engagement and socialization. Each of these therapies brought joy and positive change into his daily life.""

Palliative care services also included a medical team to help with medical support and crisis management, Barbara says. ""They could come to the house, diagnose a problem, and prescribe and provide treatment. We didn't have to go to the hospital for every problem."" Having home-based medical support allowed the family to treat problems in their own home, which became especially important as Jake got older.

Embracing a difficult but important path

A chaplain and a social worker paid regular visits to the Swoyer home.

""In 25 years of caring for a child with limited life expectancy, these were two of the more meaningful and pivotal people I had the opportunity to work with,"" Barbara says. They were open to and encouraged philosophical discussion about Jake's eventual end of life.

""They helped us consider and define our goals of care,"" Barbara says. ""From these conversations, we felt at peace with past decisions and better equipped to make future decisions on Jake's behalf. It was a relief to have these discussions in periods of calm, rather than in moments of crisis.""

Barbara is a founding member of the Parent Advisory Board for Courageous Parents Network, a nonprofit organization that helps families and providers caring for children with serious illness. Her wish is for families to understand that palliative care is about helping a child live well in the face of life-threatening disease.

""It's about bringing happiness and comfort to a child, while also supporting the entire family unit, no matter where they are on their journey with serious illness,"" she says.

How pediatric palliative care can benefit your family

326,New Research on Palliative Care and COVID-19,"Jean Kutner, M.D., a professor of medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, is a well-known expert in palliative and hospice care. She is also a top researcher in the field. She says palliative care ""focuses on the whole person, addressing their spiritual, psychological, and medical needs along the whole course of their journey with a serious illness.""

This year, the COVID-19 pandemic has spotlighted the need for doctors and nurses trained in palliative care. Hospitals are treating thousands of seriously ill patients. Many of them may end up on life support with their families unable to be with them.

Dr. Kutner discussed how palliative care teams are helping patients and families during this time.

Doctors and nurses trained in palliative care have been in high demand during the pandemic. Has the crisis shown people how this kind of care can help patients and their families?

Yes, absolutely. At hospitals across the country, there has been increased demand for palliative care teams. They help overwhelmed families, patients, and hospital staff cope with this very serious illness. It has been especially hard for patients and families who have to be separated because the virus is so contagious. A palliative care team can support families that have to make difficult decisions. The pandemic has also shown the importance of having conversations about the goals of care—such as, do you want to be on a ventilator?—and documenting someone who can make medical decisions for a patient who is seriously ill or dying. This is also known as a health care proxy.

""A palliative care team can support families that have to make difficult decisions."" – Jean Kutner, M.D.

Much of the early research on the benefits of palliative care involved cancer patients. How is the scope of palliative care expanding?

It's true that palliative care had its roots in helping people with cancer. In the last five-plus years, there has been more work with people who have Parkinson's, ALS, heart failure, lung diseases like COPD, advanced kidney disease, and dementia. These groups have different needs than cancer patients. There's also been exciting research supporting children and adolescents with progressive, life-limiting illness.

Can you tell us about the NIH-funded research you are involved in?

I am the lead researcher in a large national project funded by the National Institute of Nursing Research on providing training for other palliative care researchers. I'm also doing research on training palliative care providers to help families with the most difficult conversations regarding a family member's health.

Until recently, people may not have heard of palliative care or confused it with hospice care. Is that changing?

When I gave talks to public groups about palliative care 10 years ago, I often would get blank stares. But that is changing. More people have heard of it. There is also a growing number of patient and provider groups who are huge advocates of it. I especially see that among our nursing and medical school students, even clinical psychology students. When I do interviews for residency programs in internal medicine, the students ask about rotations in palliative care. They feel it's important. This generation of trainees is truly going to change this field.",magazine.medlineplus.gov

Community Supports for Rural Aging in Place and Independent Living

Older adults (those aged 65 and older) and people with disabilities have unique healthcare needs and often face challenges to meeting these needs. In addition, accessible housing, transportation, employment, educational programs, and specialized healthcare may be limited in many parts of rural America. Community organizations, healthcare facilities, local governments, and other rural entities can help older adults and people with disabilities by collaborating and creatively using limited resources to provide needed services.

This guide includes information about home-based services and community supports available to support aging in place and independent living and discusses challenges for people receiving services and those providing them. For information related to services for veterans with service-related injuries, see Rural Veterans and Access to Healthcare.

Frequently Asked Questions

What types of services and supports can help rural residents to age in place and live independently, and who delivers these services?

Older individuals and people with disabilities may experience physical limitations and need to rely on others for help with activities of daily living. This can be particularly challenging in rural areas. Home and Community-Based Alternatives to Nursing Home Care notes that a wide range of services can help individuals live independently. Types of services that can support aging in place and independent living include, but are not limited to:

Family caregivers, community business and nonprofit organizations, paid home care workers, senior centers, tribal organizations, and volunteers can all provide help to people in rural communities. However, home health services, which are specifically medical in nature, must be provided by skilled medical professionals.

The National Academy for State Health Policy's 2019 Toolkit: State Strategies to Support Older Adults Aging in Place in Rural Areas describes a variety of state initiatives designed to help older rural adults remain in their communities. SASH® (Support and Services at Home) utilizes affordable housing communities throughout Vermont to provide care and services to older adults and individuals with disabilities and promote independent living. The ARcare Aging Well Outreach Network, run by the ARcare Federally Qualified Health Center, provides services including falls prevention assessments, transportation to appointments, medication management, and senior-specific exercise opportunities for Cross County, Arkansas residents over 50 years of age.

For additional examples of home-based services and community supports in rural communities, see the RHIhub's Rural Aging in Place and Access to Care for Rural People with Disabilities Toolkits.

What other services and supports might people with disabilities need in order to live successfully in a rural community?

People with disabilities may use some of the same services and supports as older adults to be able to live independently in rural areas. However, rural residents with disabilities may also benefit from other services and supports. For example, they may experience pain and other secondary conditions that may make it difficult to hold a job. As a result, people with disabilities may need specialized training or rehabilitation services or other assistance to overcome barriers to employment or pursue self-employment. Farm Assessment and Rehabilitation Methods (FARM) Program is one example of a program designed to help disabled farmers continue or resume farming or find an alternative agricultural occupation.

People with disabilities may also need assistance connecting with community services and supports as they transition from a facility back into the community or as they transition into adulthood. Centers for Independent Living (CILs) provide individuals with disabilities with services to help them live independently, including referrals, independent living skills training, and peer counseling. CILs can also offer additional services, including job search support, assistive technology information, and housing option counseling.

People with disabilities and functional limitations also require additional supports in emergency situations. Individuals who are hard of hearing may not hear sirens or other audible alerts, while those with vision impairments may not see flashing lights or other signals. In an emergency, people who use assistive technologies or durable medical equipment may need access to back-up sources of power. Additionally, people with functional disabilities may need accessible transportation options or shelters if evacuation is necessary. For information on preparing and responding to emergencies in rural communities, see RHIhub's Rural Emergency Preparedness and Response topic guide.

Why is it important for people living in rural areas to have access to home-based services and community supports?

Older adults and people with disabilities living in rural areas, like their urban counterparts, typically prefer to live in their own homes, rather than in assisted living facilities or nursing homes. While they may be able to thrive in the community, older adults and individuals with disabilities may also need some assistance in carrying out key everyday activities such as bathing or cooking. Similarly, Differences in Social Isolation and Its Relationship to Health by Rurality highlights that while older adults in rural areas report larger social networks than their urban counterparts, they experience increased risks of social isolation and loneliness. Social isolation among older adults has been linked to poor health outcomes and increased healthcare spending. As a result, rural areas may need to provide additional services and supports to keep older adults and people with disabilities included and active in community life. Older adults and people with disabilities may also face additional challenges in rural areas related to:

Transportation to medical appointments, grocery shopping, and other essential and leisure activities

Housing quality and affordability, including how to pay for needed repairs, modifications, and assistive technologies that would allow them to continue to live safely in the home

Availability of home-based services and community supports in their communities that will allow them to live independently at home.

Paid caregiver workforce shortages.

Support for informal caregivers to prevent feelings of isolation and burnout.

Meeting the Social Needs of Older Adults in Rural Areas demonstrates how home-based services and community supports can foster social connections as well as connect residents with needs and services that promote health and wellness.

What are livable communities, and how do they facilitate aging in place and independent living in rural communities?

Livable communities meet the full range of needs of all its residents. Partners for Livable Communities defines livability as “the sum of the factors that add up to a community's quality of life—including the built and natural environments, economic prosperity, social stability and equity, educational opportunity, and cultural, entertainment and recreation possibilities.” AARP also notes that a livable community will “enhance personal independence; allow residents to remain in their homes and communities; and foster residents' engagement in the community's civic, economic, and social life.” As a result, the exact characteristics of livability will be unique to each community.

The terms “aging in place” and “independent living” describe different aspects of livable communities. People who want to age in place are those who want to remain in a place of their choice, typically one in which they have invested time and money, where they have an informal support network and which holds fond memories for them. There are typically fewer housing options available in rural communities, making it difficult to downsize or find accessible housing. Also, home repairs or modifications may be necessary for an individual to remain in their community. Similarly, nutrition services may be necessary for adults who cannot safely cook for themselves. For more information on aging in place in rural communities, see the RHIhub's Rural Aging in Place Toolkit.

The term independent living can simply refer to an arrangement in which people with disabilities live in a community rather than in an institutional setting. Interpreted more broadly, it is a philosophy which promotes the idea that people with disabilities have the same civil rights as people without disabilities, and should make their own decisions about how they will live, work, and participate in society in the least restrictive environment. This approach focuses on ensuring that communities meet the needs of all people who live there.

Universal design principles should be considered when designing rural infrastructure. Universal design goes beyond meeting accessibility standards and seeks to address usability concerns for people of all ages and abilities throughout the entire design of a building or community. Curb cuts are one example of universal design. Originally designed to improve access for individuals with mobility and visual impairments, curb cuts also assist cyclists, families with strollers, and travelers with luggage, among many others.

By embracing the concepts of aging in place, independent living, and universal design, communities can help individuals remain and thrive in their homes or community setting of their choice, no matter their age or ability. For information on evidence-based and promising models and resources to support organizations and communities in creating rural livable communities, see the RHIhub's Rural Aging in Place and Access to Care for Rural People with Disabilities Toolkits.

What resources are available to find services for older adults and individuals with disabilities who wish to remain in their homes?

The National Institute on Aging's webpage Aging in Place: Growing Old at Home offers suggestions for planning ahead to stay at home, lists the kinds of supports that may be needed, and offers contact information for various agencies and programs that can provide help and guidance. It notes that resources can include:

Friends, family, and neighbors

Community businesses and nonprofit organizations

Geriatric care managers

Senior centers

Area Agencies on Aging

Tribal organizations

Federal, state, and local government resources

The World Health Organization defines age-friendly environments as ones that:

“foster health and well-being and the participation of people as they age. They are accessible, equitable, inclusive, safe and secure, and supportive. They promote health and prevent or delay the onset of disease and functional decline. They provide people-centered services and support to enable recovery or to compensate for the loss of function so that people can continue to do the things that are important to them.”

Centers for Independent Living are community-based, consumer-controlled nonprofit organizations funded by the Administration for Community Living (ACL) to provide individuals with disabilities a range of services to promote independent living. While CILs can offer more services, they are required to provide information and referral services, independent living skills training, peer counseling, and services that facilitate transition from nursing homes and other institutions to the community. ACL maintains a state-by-state list of Centers for Independent Living.

The Grantmakers in Aging publication Guiding Principles for the Sustainability of Age-Friendly Community Efforts notes that “Champions for age-friendly communities can be found in neighborhoods, elected offices, non-profit organizations, universities, and businesses.” Churches and local nonprofit organizations may be helpful in providing services or referrals. Age-Friendly and Dementia-Friendly Winnemucca and Humboldt County describes how the rural community of Winnemucca, Nevada, worked to create an age-friendly and dementia-friendly community that expanded to Humboldt County.

The National PACE (Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly) Association supports and promotes programs that provide comprehensive medical care and community-based services to help older people live as independently as possible for as long as possible. RHIhub's Rural Services Integration Toolkit highlights the work of Senior CommUnity Care (Delta and Montrose Counties, Colorado), an example of a rural PACE program. For a list of currently operating PACE centers, search Find a PACE Program in Your Neighborhood.

The Eldercare Locator, 1.800.677.1116, provides access to state and local Area Agencies on Aging, as well as community-based organizations and services addressing a range of concerns, including housing, transportation, elder abuse prevention, and more. Churches and civic groups may also be able to make referrals to local sources for services.

What are the workforce and training challenges related to providing home-based services and community supports?

State Solutions to the Home Care Workforce Crisis in Rural America notes that many workers providing home-based services in rural areas work only part-time, earning less on average than workers in urban areas. According to the report Preventing Caregiver Turnover, low wages are a major factor in the high turnover rate among home care workers. This results in a heavier workload for employees who do remain, and creates losses in productivity, morale problems, and a lack of care management. In addition, National Survey of Area Agencies on Aging 2020 Report: Meeting the Needs of Today's Older Adults reports that workforce challenges have resulted in 62% of AAAs delaying the start of services for individuals, 59% increasing the size of staff caseloads, and 49% starting or extending waitlists for services.

As more medical care for people with multiple chronic conditions takes place in the home, the care provided in the home becomes more complex and requires additional skills. As described in the Government Accountability Office report Medicaid Home- and Community-Based Services: Selected States' Program Structures and Challenges Providing Services, recipients of home- and community-based services may have complex medical and behavioral needs and may display aggressive behaviors. In response, some organizations may offer specialized behavioral health training to help workers deal with these situations appropriately.

What does a lack of home-based services and community supports in a community mean for older adults, people with disabilities, and their families?

Caregiving in the U.S. 2020, a report from AARP and the National Alliance for Caregiving, offers a national profile of unpaid family caregivers for rural adults. Notably, family caregivers of older adults living in rural areas often do not live in a rural area themselves and continue to work while serving as a primary caregiver. The report also highlights that caregivers are likely to find it difficult to find available, affordable services in rural communities.

The report Transportation, Distance, and Health Care Utilization for Older Adults in Rural and Small Urban Areas notes that people who do not have access to reliable transportation are more likely to delay getting needed healthcare or forego it entirely. This can result in a need for emergency care or a hospitalization that could otherwise have been avoided. For more information on the consequences of a lack of transportation for rural residents who have disabilities or are older, see the RHIhub Transportation to Support Rural Healthcare topic guide.

Rural people who are unable to find necessary supports in their community may have little choice but to relocate to a nursing home. According to the policy brief Are Rural Older Adults Benefiting from Increased State Spending on Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services?, rural Medicaid beneficiaries were more likely to use skilled nursing facilities than urban Medicaid beneficiaries. Similarly, Rural Long-Term Services and Supports: A Primer describes how rural residential care facilities, such as assisted living facilities, serve populations with more diverse needs than facilities in urban areas. This may reflect that there are few long-term care options in rural areas, in addition to the possible lack of other support services in the community.

How can home-based services and community supports help informal caregivers?

The August 2019 publication Supportive Services and Caregiving for Rural Adults: Policy Brief and Recommendations to the Secretary from the National Advisory Committee on Rural Health and Human Services (NACRHHS) notes that nearly 44 million family and friends serve as informal, unpaid caregivers to older adults and individuals with disabilities each year. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one in four rural adults provide care or assistance to a friend or family member with a health concern or disability. Over half of these caregivers provide care for over two years, and 30% spend at least 20 hours per week providing care. As a result, informal caregivers can incur psychological, physical, and financial stress when caring for another individual.

Home-based services and community supports can benefit friend and family caregivers as well as patients. For example, reliable, accessible transportation services can allow caregivers to maintain regular work hours with the peace of mind that their loved ones can visit grocery stores, attend community centers, or travel to medical appointments. The Missouri Rural Health Association's HealthTran program coordinates non-emergency medical transportation for individuals who need routine and preventative medical care. Similarly, adult day centers provide supervised care to dependent adults, relieving caregivers from attending to their family members continuously throughout the day.

The policy brief Perspectives on Rural Caregiving Challenges and Interventions examines strategies for supporting informal caregivers. Key informants noted that increased financial support, development of a national strategy, and expanded access to resources would all be beneficial for informal caregivers. On a local level, the following strategies are helpful:

Increase awareness of caregivers' needs through workplace programs and churches

Provide infrastructure to enable rural families to more easily access technology services

Offer training to caregivers, so that they will feel more prepared and confident in their ability to help loved ones

Improve Medicaid services

Expand family leave policies and economic incentives for caregivers

Offer screening for caregiver depression and isolation

The 2019 Milbank Memorial Fund report In Support of Family Caregivers: A Snapshot of Five States notes that as demographics change and the country has a larger percentage of older Americans, there will be a need for public policies to support family and unpaid caregivers. For example, the Maine housing administration provides up to $3,800 in tax credits for home modifications for older adults, and Minnesota used grant funding from its Live Well at Home program to partner with Chicago REST (Respite Education Support Tools) to increase the availability of respite care for caregivers.

Resources for Caregiving in Rural Communities gives descriptions and contact information for several national and state-level programs that provide services.

For more information on the challenges and opportunities informal caregivers experience in adopting technology to aid their caregiving efforts, read the Rural Monitor article Informal Caregiving and Technology in Rural America.

What is the Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services Waiver Program?

In the past, long-term support services funded by Medicaid have typically been delivered in nursing facilities or other institutions. However, Medicaid's home and community-based services waivers (HCBS or 1915(c) Waivers) allow states to develop programs to meet needs of Medicaid beneficiaries who want to remain in their own homes or communities. States can apply for multiple waivers to tailor programs and services to specific groups identified by age or diagnosis. Waiver programs must:

Show that the services provided under the waiver will not cost more than the same services provided in an institution.

Ensure that people's health and welfare will be protected

Establish standards for providers to meet the needs of the participants

Develop and follow a plan of care that is individualized and person-centered

Key State Policy Choices About Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services highlights the variation in how these services are provided at the state level. However, Are Rural Older Adults Benefiting from Increased State Spending on Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services?, a 2016 report from the Maine Rural Health Research Center, examines how urban and rural older adults utilize these services differently.

For more information, see Medicaid's Home & Community-Based Services 1915(c).

What other funding opportunities are available for rural home-based services and community supports?

Local agencies such as Area Agencies on Aging, Aging and Disability Resource Centers, Centers for Independent Living and nonprofit or faith-based organizations are often the best funding sources for rural home-based services. For a list of grant programs and organizations that have funded activities to support aging in place and independent living, see the Funding & Opportunities section of this topic guide.

What are some food and nutrition programs for seniors in rural communities who spend most of their time at home?

The Administration for Community Living's Administration on Aging administers the Nutrition Services Program, which provides grants to states to promote nutrition services programs for older adults. These include:

Home-delivered meals

Meals served in group settings, such as community centers

Nutrition screening

Assessment

Education

Counseling

The programs are intended to reach people age 60 and above who have the greatest social and economic needs. Section 339 of the Older Americans Act of 1965 provides nutrition services programs the ability to also serve spouses of any age, people who provide volunteer services during meal hours, and people with disabilities. Priority is given to the following groups:

Low-income adults

Members of minority groups

Seniors in rural areas

Seniors who have limited proficiency in English

Seniors at risk for needing institutional care

According to the Administration on Community Living (ACL), “home-delivered meals are often the first in-home service that an older adult receives, and the program is a primary access point for other home and community-based services.” A 2015 research brief, Older Americans Benefit from Older Americans Act Nutrition Programs, highlights the connection between the health and ability of recipients of these services to remain at home.

Meals on Wheels America has more than two million staff members and volunteers who deliver meals to frail, homebound, or isolated seniors. The organization notes on its website that it serves “virtually every community in America,” and provides funding, leadership, education, research, and advocacy support.

Some rural communities have food pantries, which may provide food and other basic products. The Rural Monitor article Food Pantries Serving More and More of the Rural Poor gives examples of rural food pantry programs which are funded by federal programs, state governments, foundations, businesses, religious organizations, and individuals.

For more information about nutrition programs for rural seniors, see RHIhub's Rural Hunger and Access to Healthy Food topic guide.

Where can I find information on community-based transportation services?

People in rural areas often have difficulty finding adequate transportation. Those with medical needs requiring specialized care available only in larger communities may find it particularly challenging to access affordable, long-distance transportation to these locations.

The National Aging and Disability Transportation Center (NADTC), a partnership between the Federal Transit Administration, Easterseals, and the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging, promotes transportation availability and accessibility for older adults, people with disabilities, and their caregivers. It offers training and webinars, and Resources & Publications that are available for download.

The National Rural Transit Assistance Program Directory of State RTAP Managers offers a searchable directory of state Rural Transit Assistance Program managers, and VirtualCAP provides information and resources used by Community Action Agencies to help people become self-sufficient in rural and urban areas.

328,What Is Telemental Health?,"What is Telemental Health?

Telemental health is the use of telecommunications or videoconferencing technology to provide mental health services. It is sometimes referred to as telepsychiatry or telepsychology. Research suggests that telemental health services can be effective for many people, including, but not limited to those with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety.

As the need for providing virtual mental health care services has increased, providers are finding ways to use phone and videoconferencing technology to bring therapy, evaluations, interventions, and medication management to individuals where they are.

Although the practice has become much more common, especially as a result of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, more research is needed to understand when and how telemental health services should be used.

332,Comfort Care for Kids and Their Families: A Mother's Story,"When Jake Swoyer was born in 1995, he seemed like any other healthy baby boy. His family—parents, John and Barbara Swoyer, and big brother Ryan, then 3— were thrilled.

But when Jake, who is from Sudbury, Massachusetts, was 7 months old, he had his first seizure. After that, ""he got very sick, very quickly,"" his mother says. His seizures came frequently and could last up to an hour. ""We had 23 ambulance rides in that first year.""

""I had no idea what palliative care really was or what it could do for us."" – Barbara Swoyer

Despite a lot of testing, doctors were unable to determine a cause for his seizures until Jake was nearly 10 years old, when a test revealed he had a genetic mutation associated with Dravet syndrome. Dravet syndrome is a lifelong, rare form of epilepsy that begins in the first year of life and typically doesn't respond to medication. Jake was also later diagnosed with mitochondrial dysfunction, adding to the severity and complexity of his disease.

Since he was diagnosed, Jake has suffered a long, slow, steady decline in his health, his mother says. Palliative care has made all the difference in how the family has coped with Jake's devastating condition and in helping Jake enjoy a good quality of life. He received pediatric palliative care support and services until he turned 21.

Finding palliative care

""When Jake was first diagnosed, our physician suggested enrolling him in palliative care. Like many families, my first thought was, 'Oh no, he thinks my son is dying.' I had no idea what palliative care really was or what it could do for us,"" Barbara recalls.

She finally took his suggestion after about a year. As Barbara worked with several different providers, ""a light bulb finally went off. I realized what palliative care was supposed to be,"" she says. ""Along with providing clinical and emotional support, the palliative team introduced comfort care measures. Jake was able to receive pet therapy for enjoyment, massage therapy for relaxation, and music therapy for active engagement and socialization. Each of these therapies brought joy and positive change into his daily life.""

Palliative care services also included a medical team to help with medical support and crisis management, Barbara says. ""They could come to the house, diagnose a problem, and prescribe and provide treatment. We didn't have to go to the hospital for every problem."" Having home-based medical support allowed the family to treat problems in their own home, which became especially important as Jake got older.

Embracing a difficult but important path

A chaplain and a social worker paid regular visits to the Swoyer home.

""In 25 years of caring for a child with limited life expectancy, these were two of the more meaningful and pivotal people I had the opportunity to work with,"" Barbara says. They were open to and encouraged philosophical discussion about Jake's eventual end of life.

""They helped us consider and define our goals of care,"" Barbara says. ""From these conversations, we felt at peace with past decisions and better equipped to make future decisions on Jake's behalf. It was a relief to have these discussions in periods of calm, rather than in moments of crisis.""

Barbara is a founding member of the Parent Advisory Board for Courageous Parents Network, a nonprofit organization that helps families and providers caring for children with serious illness. Her wish is for families to understand that palliative care is about helping a child live well in the face of life-threatening disease.

""It's about bringing happiness and comfort to a child, while also supporting the entire family unit, no matter where they are on their journey with serious illness,"" she says.

333,New Research on Palliative Care and COVID-19,"Jean Kutner, M.D., a professor of medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, is a well-known expert in palliative and hospice care. She is also a top researcher in the field. She says palliative care ""focuses on the whole person, addressing their spiritual, psychological, and medical needs along the whole course of their journey with a serious illness.""

This year, the COVID-19 pandemic has spotlighted the need for doctors and nurses trained in palliative care. Hospitals are treating thousands of seriously ill patients. Many of them may end up on life support with their families unable to be with them.

Dr. Kutner discussed how palliative care teams are helping patients and families during this time.

Doctors and nurses trained in palliative care have been in high demand during the pandemic. Has the crisis shown people how this kind of care can help patients and their families?

Yes, absolutely. At hospitals across the country, there has been increased demand for palliative care teams. They help overwhelmed families, patients, and hospital staff cope with this very serious illness. It has been especially hard for patients and families who have to be separated because the virus is so contagious. A palliative care team can support families that have to make difficult decisions. The pandemic has also shown the importance of having conversations about the goals of care—such as, do you want to be on a ventilator?—and documenting someone who can make medical decisions for a patient who is seriously ill or dying. This is also known as a health care proxy.

""A palliative care team can support families that have to make difficult decisions."" – Jean Kutner, M.D.

Much of the early research on the benefits of palliative care involved cancer patients. How is the scope of palliative care expanding?

It's true that palliative care had its roots in helping people with cancer. In the last five-plus years, there has been more work with people who have Parkinson's, ALS, heart failure, lung diseases like COPD, advanced kidney disease, and dementia. These groups have different needs than cancer patients. There's also been exciting research supporting children and adolescents with progressive, life-limiting illness.

Can you tell us about the NIH-funded research you are involved in?

I am the lead researcher in a large national project funded by the National Institute of Nursing Research on providing training for other palliative care researchers. I'm also doing research on training palliative care providers to help families with the most difficult conversations regarding a family member's health.

Until recently, people may not have heard of palliative care or confused it with hospice care. Is that changing?

When I gave talks to public groups about palliative care 10 years ago, I often would get blank stares. But that is changing. More people have heard of it. There is also a growing number of patient and provider groups who are huge advocates of it. I especially see that among our nursing and medical school students, even clinical psychology students. When I do interviews for residency programs in internal medicine, the students ask about rotations in palliative care. They feel it's important. This generation of trainees is truly going to change this field.",magazine.medlineplus.gov

336,If You're about to Become a Cancer Caregiver,"If You’re About to Become a Cancer Caregiver

Caregiver is defined here as the person who most often helps the person with cancer and is not paid to do so. In most cases, the main (primary) caregiver is a spouse, partner, parent, or an adult child. When family is not around, close friends, co-workers, or neighbors may fill this role. The caregiver has a key role in the patient’s care. Good, reliable caregiver support is crucial to the physical and emotional well-being of people with cancer.

Today, most cancer treatment is given in outpatient treatment centers – not in hospitals. This means someone is needed to be part of the day-to-day care of the person with cancer and that sicker people are being cared for at home. As a result, caregivers have many roles. These roles change as the patient’s needs change during and after cancer treatment.

Caregivers serve as home health aides and companions. They may help feed, dress, and bathe the patient. Caregivers arrange schedules, manage insurance issues, and provide transportation. They are legal assistants, financial managers, and housekeepers. They often have to take over the duties of the person with cancer, and still meet the needs of other family members.

On top of the normal day-to-day tasks, such as meals, cleaning, and driving or arranging transportation, as a caregiver, you’ll also become an important part of the cancer care team. This busy schedule could leave you with no time to take care of your own needs. You also may feel the need to turn down job opportunities, work fewer hours, or even retire early to meet the demands of being a caregiver.

Here are some things to think about if you are about to become a caregiver for a person with cancer.

What does it feel like to be a caregiver?

Despite the sadness and shock of having a loved one with cancer, many people find personal satisfaction in caring for that person. You may see it as a meaningful role that allows you to show your love and respect for the person. It may also feel good to be helpful and know that you’re needed by a loved one.

You might find that caregiving enriches your life. You might feel a deep sense of satisfaction, confidence, and accomplishment in caring for someone. You may also learn about inner strengths and abilities that you didn’t even know you had, and find a greater sense of purpose for your own life.

The caregiving role can open up doors to new friends and relationships, too. Through a support group, you can get to know people who have faced the same kinds of problems. Caregiving can also draw families together and help people feel closer to the person who needs care.

Caregiving can also be frustrating and painful. People caring for very sick patients may notice their own feelings of severe sadness and emotional distress. They may feel sadness and grief over their loved one’s illness and may also feel overwhelmed or frustrated as they try to manage many difficult problems.

Caregivers can develop physical symptoms, like tiredness and trouble sleeping. This is more likely to be a problem for caregivers who aren’t able to get the support they need, and who don’t take care of themselves – especially those who try to press forward alone, even as their own quality of life suffers.

Caring for someone going through cancer treatment can be demanding, but being good at it can give you a sense of meaning and pride. These good feelings can help provide the strength and endurance to continue in the role for as long as needed.

What if you don't want to be the caregiver?

It’s quite normal to feel overwhelmed, burdened, and even trapped at times while caregiving. If your family has had troubled relationships in the past, you may wonder “why me?” You may feel that the caregiver role was dumped on you without your consent. You may feel unprepared or even unable to manage the responsibilities and feelings that go with it. You may feel pressure from family members, friends, and members of the cancer care team to provide care, despite having little or no desire or ability to do so.

If you became a caregiver because of other people’s wishes, you need to think about how you feel about being pressured into caregiving. Mixed feelings at the onset of this role can lead to a greater sense of frustration later on. You should decide on your limits and make them known as soon as you can – before the demands of caregiving become a problem. It’s not easy to do this when others resist the change, and it can take a lot of courage to do it. If you know you’re going to meet with resistance, talk with the patient’s team social worker first. Or you can ask their doctor about a referral so you can talk with someone about the caregiver problem.

Addressing the problems early can help you and the patient get the help you need, and if you have to, make other plans for care. In situations like this, it might be helpful to find someone to help you with caregiving so that you know from the start that the role will be shared. It also may be better to find someone else to act as the primary (main) caregiver.

You’ll need to take care of yourself, too

It’s hard to plan for a major health problem like cancer. Suddenly you’ve been asked to care for the person with cancer, and you’re also needed to help make decisions about medical care and treatment. None of this is easy. There will be times when you know you’ve done well, and times when you just want to give up. This is normal.

There are many causes of stress and distress in cancer caregivers. Dealing with the crisis of cancer in someone you love, the uncertain future, financial worries, difficult decisions, and unexpected and unwanted lifestyle changes are just a few of them. Fear, hopelessness, guilt, confusion, doubt, anger, and helplessness can take a toll on both the person with cancer and the caregiver. And while the focus tends to be on the patient, all of this will affect your physical and mental health, too.

Depression

Depression is common in caregivers. But caregiving does not always cause depression and not all caregivers have the difficult emotions that go with depression. Everyone has emotional ups and downs, but if a person always feels down, has no energy, cries a lot, or is easily angered, it may be a warning sign of depression.

Many people see the feelings of depression as a sign of weakness rather than a sign that something is out of balance, but ignoring or denying these feelings won’t make them go away. Early attention to symptoms of depression can make a big difference in how the caregiver feels about their role and how well they can do the things they need to do.

There are ways to help reduce stress and remind you to enjoy life. They might help prevent a more serious depression that can develop over time:

Support from family and friends in caring for the patient

Exercise

A healthy diet

Spiritual support, such as religious activity, prayer, journaling, or meditation

Recreational time, when you can enjoy friends socially

Help from a trained mental health professional

But caregivers often focus on the person with cancer and don’t take care of themselves. You may be a caregiver, but you still have your own needs that cannot and should not be put aside.

Plan things that you enjoy

There are 3 types of activities that you need to do for yourself:

Those that involve other people, such as having lunch with a friend.

Those that give you a sense of accomplishment, like exercising or finishing a project.

Those that make you feel good or relaxed, like watching a funny movie or taking a walk.

Make an effort to notice and talk about things you do as they happen during the day. Watch the news or take time to read the morning paper. Set aside time during the day, like during a meal, when you do not talk about illness.

Getting professional help if you think you need it

It’s normal to feel overwhelmed sometimes by caregiver responsibilities. But if it becomes a constant problem, you may need to see a mental health professional. Below is a list of serious signs of trouble. Get professional help if you:

Feel depressed, physically sick, or hopeless

Feel like hurting yourself or hurting or yelling at the people you care for

Depend too heavily on alcohol or recreational drugs

Fight with your spouse, children, stepchildren, or other family members and friends

Are no longer taking care of yourself

Take a break or time for yourself

Most caregivers hesitate to take a break from their caregiving responsibilities, even for a short time. In fact, most would probably feel guilty if they did this. But no one can be a caregiver every day, 24 hours a day, for many months and even years. Try to get out of the house and away from your loved one every day – even if it’s only to take a short walk or shop for food. If you can’t leave the patient alone and don’t have friends or family to relieve you, you might want to look into getting help from respite caregivers.

Respite care

Respite care is the term used to describe short-term, temporary relief for those who are caring for family members who might otherwise need professional care. Respite is a short break from the exhausting challenges of being a caregiver. It’s been shown to help keep family caregivers healthy and improve their sense of well-being.

In most cases, the respite caregiver comes to the home and gets to know the patient, the family routine, and things like where medicines are stored. Sitter-companion services are one respite option. This is sometimes offered by local civic groups, church or religious groups, and other community organizations. A regular sitter-companion can provide friendly respite care for a few hours, once or twice a week. Be sure that the sitter-companion knows what to do if there’s an emergency while the caregiver is gone.

Another type of respite uses a specialized, local facility where the patient may stay for a few days or even a few weeks. This gives the caregiver a chance to take a vacation from caregiving and catch their breath, whether or not they leave town.

Depending on your state, Medicaid or Medicare may help cover respite costs. Also check with the patient’s health insurance to see what kind of respite help might be offered.

Know what you can’t do

Most importantly, don’t try to do it all yourself. Caregiving alone for any period of time is not realistic. Reach out to others. Involve them in your life and in the things you must do for your loved one.

Some caregivers feel they have to do it all alone. They may believe that, as the partner, sibling, son, or daughter they’re responsible for the sick loved one. It’s painful for them to admit that they can’t do it all and still keep their own health and sanity. They’ll bend over backward to meet their loved one’s every need. Some feel guilty if they can’t do it all and say they feel “selfish” if they ask for help.

Set realistic limits on what you can do. For instance, if you have a back injury, and/or if your loved one is too big for you to lift, you may be able to help them roll over in bed, but don’t try to lift them alone or catch them when they fall. (You may end up seriously injured or sick and become unable to help anyone.) There are ways you can safely help a person sit up or walk but you have to learn to do it without hurting yourself. This is where expert help is needed – home care nurses or physical therapists can show you how to do it safely. They can also help you get special equipment, if needed.

Your own health and safety must come first if you want to keep helping your loved one.

When you need help, reach out to others, including professionals. Talk with the cancer care team about what you’re doing and where you need help. Involve them in your life and your loved one’s care.

Finding support for yourself

The support of friends and family is key to both the person with cancer and the caregiver. There are many kinds of support programs, including one-on-one or group counseling and support groups. A support group can be a powerful tool for both people with cancer and those who care about them. Talking with others who are in situations like yours can help ease loneliness. You can also get useful ideas from others that might help you.

Talk with a nurse or social worker or contact your local American Cancer Society to learn about services in your area. Talking with other caregivers can help you feel less alone. If you can’t visit a group in person, the American Cancer Society has the Cancer Survivors Network (CSN), an online community of people whose lives have been touched by cancer. Other organizations have internet-based groups and even online counseling, too. Through online or in person support groups, people can share their stories, offer practical advice, and support each other through shared experiences.

Religion can be a source of strength for some people. Some members of the clergy are specially trained to help people with cancer and their families. People who are not religious may find spiritual support in other ways. Meditation, journaling, and being outside in nature are examples of different ways a person may feel they’re part of something greater than themselves.

Ask others to help

Caregivers need a range of support services to stay healthy, be good caregivers, and stay in the caregiving role. But they often don’t know where to go for help or how to accept help.

Caregivers have been shown to have less distress and feel less burdened when they have social support. Human connections can help you stay strong. Let people know what you need and ask for help. You cannot and should not try to be responsible for all the caregiving by yourself.

You need to know who you can talk to and count on for help. Families facing cancer can become stronger. If family members don’t offer help, or if you need more help than they can give you, you may be able to set up a circle of friends to help you. Church members, neighbors, and others may be willing to help. Include them in “family meetings.” Share information with them on the patient’s condition, needs, and care.

Allowing others to help can take some of the pressure off and give you time to take care of yourself. Often family and friends want to help but may not know how or what you need. Here are some tips for including family and friends:

Look for situations where you need help. Make a list or note them on a calendar.

Hold regular family meetings to keep everyone involved. Use these meetings as updates and care-planning sessions. Include the patient.

Ask family and friends when they can help and what jobs they think they can do. You may also contact a person with a certain request. Be very clear about what you need.

As you hear back from each person, note it on your list to make sure they have taken care of what you needed.

There are many online resources that can help you manage your job as caregiver. Some sites offer support for people caring for a loved one who has cancer. Other sites have features like group calendars to organize helpers and areas to create personal websites that concerned people can access for updates. . Some of these also allow others to sign up for specific tasks when help is needed. Taking full advantage of the resources available to you is another way you can take care of yourself.

Caring for your children during this time

If you have young children, you’ll need to figure out how to take care of them and their needs while you’re caring for the person with cancer. Juggling children’s schedules and trying to keep their lives as normal as possible often requires a great deal more help from friends and family members. As you’re setting up care for the person with cancer, you might also need to tap into other parents and trusted friends and neighbors for help with your children.

Children can sense stress in their family members and notice that there’s less time for them. They may start to have trouble in school or act like they did when they were younger. Even though your time is limited, you’ll need to take time to check in with them to learn about their fears and concerns.

For more information, see Helping Children With Cancer in the Family: Dealing with Diagnosis and Helping Children With Cancer in the Family: Dealing With Treatment.

Being a caregiver and keeping your job

Caregiving itself can be a full-time job, but many caregivers already have paying jobs. This can lead to work-related issues like missed days, low productivity, and work interruptions. Some caregivers even need to take unpaid leave, turn down promotions, or lose work benefits. The stress of caring for someone on top of worrying about keeping your job can be overwhelming. Dealing with these issues is important to both the employer and the employee.

There will be times when there will be more demands on the caregiver, for instance, when the patient is diagnosed, getting cancer treatment, getting treatment for recurrence, or nearing the end of life. The employed caregiver may end up having to take time off from their paying job for caregiving.

For people in certain types of jobs (temps, freelancers, consultants, entrepreneurs), this is very difficult. If they don’t work, they don’t get paid. For those with traditional jobs in larger companies, there may be benefits to help you take time off and still keep your job.

Some people find that there’s no one else to care for the cancer patient on a long-term basis, and cut back to working part time. Some feel that they have to quit their jobs entirely. If you need to keep your job but the interruptions and time off are creating problems, you might want to look into a different schedule to fit the times your loved one needs you most. Some companies allow you to take some paid leave if you are caring for a spouse or close relative. You might be able to work half-days or split shifts, or take one day a week off for doctor visits, for example.

If you need some time away from work, speak with your boss or benefits office. If your workplace has an Employee Assistance Program, look into what it offers. Some offer counseling services for money concerns, stress, and depression.

The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) guarantees up to 12 weeks off per year to take care of a seriously ill family member (spouse, parent, or child). It only applies to larger companies, and not every employee qualifies for it. If you can’t or don’t want to stop working, you might be able to take unpaid time off under the FMLA.

You may find that the people you work with treat you differently because of the time you must spend on caregiving tasks. This can affect you personally, as well as financially.

Keeping your health insurance if you have to quit your job

When caregivers quit their jobs, they usually lose their employer’s health insurance coverage as well as their source of income. It’s very important for you still to have some type of health care coverage. If you’re able to pay for your own insurance, COBRA will allow you to be covered for some months after you leave your job. Another option might be insurance from the Health Insurance Marketplace.

If you make mistakes

No matter what you do, you will very likely come to a point where you feel that you’ve failed in some way. It seems obvious that as a caregiver, you do the best you can. You try to include the patient, other concerned family members, and close friends in important discussions. You always try to make decisions that are in the patient’s best interest – decisions that you and the patient can live with. But sometimes you’ll feel that you could have handled a situation better or done something a better way.

At these times, it’s important not to blame yourself. Find a way to forgive yourself and move on. It helps to keep in mind that you will keep making mistakes, just like everyone else. Try to keep a sense of humor about it. And try to recognize those things that you do well, too. These things are often easy to overlook. It also helps to keep in mind why you chose to take on this often difficult and stressful job.

337,COVID-19 Vaccine Considerations for People with Disabilities,"What People with Disabilities and Care Providers Need to Know About COVID-19 Vaccines

This webpage provides information for people with disabilities or conditions that may increase their risk of getting and spreading COVID-19, and for their care providers. If you do not see the information you need, please check the CDC COVID-19 Vaccine Information page.

Information on COVID-19 vaccines is updated regularly. Check back for updated information.

Get a COVID-19 vaccine

Vaccines are now available to help protect you from getting COVID-19. Disability alone does not put you at higher risk for getting COVID-19. You may be at higher risk because of where you live, such as a long-term care home. You may be at risk because you need to have close contact with care providers. You may also be at risk because you have difficulty wearing a mask, staying at least 6 feet away from other people, or washing your hands.

Many people with disabilities have diabetes, cancer, heart disease, or obesity. These conditions may put you at higher risk of severe illness due to COVID-19. Talk to your doctor about your health conditions that may put you at higher risk for getting very sick from COVID-19 and about getting a COVID-19 vaccine.

Down Syndrome is one condition that may put you at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19. You might wonder why your disability is not on the underlying conditions list. Conditions are added when there is enough scientific evidence to support putting them on the list. The list is updated as new information becomes available. Please check back often for updates.

Take steps to prevent getting and spreading COVID-19.

When to get your COVID-19 vaccine

It is important that people with disabilities get the COVID-19 vaccine. Everyone 16 years of age and older is now eligible to get a COVID-19 vaccination. Get a COVID-19 vaccine as soon as you can. Widespread vaccination is a critical tool to help stop the pandemic.

How to get a COVID-19 vaccine for my care provider

You might have someone who helps you with your day-to-day activities, such as a care provider. Care providers may be considered essential workers in vaccination plans. Hospice, home healthcare, and group home providers are considered essential workers. Some examples of home healthcare providers are skilled nurses and therapists and other people who provide personal care services in the home.

A parent or family member might help you with your day-to-day activities. People who help you with your care might be able to get the COVID-19 vaccine at the same time as you do, depending on what state they live in. Your family member or care provider can contact the health department in the state they live in to find out if they can get the COVID-19 vaccine when you do.

What to expect after your vaccination

You may have mild side effects, like pain, redness, or swelling on the arm, or tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, fever or nausea. These side effects are normal and can last a few days. If you get the COVID-19 vaccine and have side effects that do not go away in a few days or have more serious symptoms, call your doctor.

With some COVID-19 vaccines, you will need 2 shots to be fully protected. The timing between your first and second shot depends on which vaccine you received. You should get your second shot as close to the recommended interval as possible. Learn which COVID-19 vaccines need two shots.

After you are fully vaccinated for COVID-19, you may be able to start doing some things that you had stopped doing because of the pandemic. Learn more about what you can do when you have been fully vaccinated.

Research shows that COVID-19 vaccine is safe for people 16 years of age and older. Call your doctor if you have questions or concerns about COVID-19 vaccine.

How to access materials about COVID-19

CDC is working to make COVID-19 resources accessible for everyone. We have resources about COVID-19 that are easy to read. We have resources for people with limited English. We also have resources in American Sign Language.

338,4 Physical Activity Tips for Older Adults,"Regular physical activity is great for your mental and physical health. It also helps you stay independent as you age.

Every day presents opportunities to move more.

The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommend that you aim to exercise at least 150 minutes every week at a moderate pace, or 75 at a more vigorous pace. The guidelines also recommend that older adults do muscle-strengthening activities at least 2 days a week.

Now sure how to get started? These tips can help.

1. Talk with your doctor. Almost anyone, at any age, can exercise safely. If you're concerned about starting an exercise routine, talk with your doctor. Ask whether there are activities you should avoid and whether any health conditions you have might affect what exercises you can do safely.

2. Start gradually. Begin with low-intensity exercises like walking. Be sure to drink plenty of water before, during, and after your workout.

3. Develop a well-rounded routine. Include the four main types of exercise:

Endurance exercises increase your breathing and heart rate. Brisk walking is a good option.

Strength exercises, like lifting weights or using a resistance band, make your muscles stronger.

Balance exercises can help prevent falls. This includes standing on one foot.

Flexibility exercises, like yoga, stretch your muscles and help you stay limber and maintain mobility as you age.

4. Move throughout the day. Every day presents opportunities to move more. For example, use the stairs instead of taking the elevator. Or park far away from the grocery store entrance instead of in the closest spot.",magazine.medlineplus.gov

1. Talk with your doctor. Almost anyone, at any age, can exercise safely. If you're concerned about starting an exercise routine, talk with your doctor. Ask whether there are activities you should avoid and whether any health conditions you have might affect what exercises you can do safely.

2. Start gradually. Begin with low-intensity exercises like walking. Be sure to drink plenty of water before, during, and after your workout.

3. Develop a well-rounded routine. Include the four main types of exercise:

Endurance exercises increase your breathing and heart rate. Brisk walking is a good option.

Strength exercises, like lifting weights or using a resistance band, make your muscles stronger.

Balance exercises can help prevent falls. This includes standing on one foot.

Flexibility exercises, like yoga, stretch your muscles and help you stay limber and maintain mobility as you age.

4. Move throughout the day. Every day presents opportunities to move more. For example, use the stairs instead of taking the elevator. Or park far away from the grocery store entrance instead of in the closest spot.",magazine.medlineplus.gov
341,Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP),"What is a basic metabolic panel (BMP)?

A basic metabolic panel (BMP) is a test that measures eight different substances in your blood. It provides important information about your body's chemical balance and metabolism. Metabolism is the process of how the body uses food and energy. A BMP includes tests for the following:

Glucose , a type of sugar and your body's main source of energy.

, a type of sugar and your body's main source of energy. Calcium , one of the body's most important minerals. Calcium is essential for proper functioning of your nerves, muscles, and heart.

, one of the body's most important minerals. Calcium is essential for proper functioning of your nerves, muscles, and heart. Sodium , potassium , carbon dioxide , and chloride . These are electrolytes, electrically charged minerals that help control the amount of fluids and the balance of acids and bases in your body.

, , , and . These are electrolytes, electrically charged minerals that help control the amount of fluids and the balance of acids and bases in your body. BUN (blood urea nitrogen) and creatinine, waste products removed from your blood by your kidneys.

Abnormal levels of any of these substances or combination of them can be a sign of a serious health problem.

342,How to Cope with Medical Test Anxiety,"What is medical test anxiety?

Medical test anxiety is a fear of medical tests. Medical tests are procedures that are used to diagnose, screen for, or monitor various diseases and conditions. While many people sometimes feel nervous or uncomfortable about testing, it doesn't usually cause serious problems or symptoms.

Medical test anxiety can be serious. It can become a type of phobia. A phobia is an anxiety disorder that causes an intense, irrational fear of something that poses little or no actual danger. Phobias can also cause physical symptoms such as rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, and trembling.",medlineplus.gov
343,Biomarkers Identified in Collegiate Athletes That Could Help Predict Time Needed to Recover From Concussion,"Biomarkers identified in collegiate athletes that could help predict time needed to recover from concussion

What

A collaborative study conducted by scientists from the National Institutes of Health, Department of Defense (DOD), and multiple academic institutions has identified blood biomarkers that could help to predict which athletes need additional time to recover from a sports related concussion. This collaboration, known as the Concussion Assessment, Research, and Education (CARE) consortium, is supported, in part, by DOD and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).

In this study, conducted at several sites across the U.S., 127 male and female collegiate athletes who had sustained a sports-related concussion were tested at several time points: shortly after injury, when their symptoms resolved, and one week after returning to play. Each athlete had also undergone preseason, baseline testing.

Using an ultrasensitive assay that can detect minute amounts of protein, the researchers tested blood serum from these athletes and identified two blood proteins that were associated with the length of time needed by the athletes to return to play. Amounts of these two proteins, tau protein and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were found to be significantly different in athletes who needed less or more than 14 days to return. While further research is needed, the results of this study are an important step towards the development of a test that could help predict which athletes need more time to recover from a concussion and resume activity.

This study was published in JAMA Network Open.

345,Measuring Blood Pressure,"What do the results mean?

Your results, also known as a blood pressure reading, will contain two numbers. The top or first number is the systolic pressure. The bottom or second number is the diastolic pressure. High blood pressure readings are also labeled by categories, ranging from normal to crisis. Your reading may show your blood pressure is:

Blood Pressure Category Systolic Blood Pressure

Diastolic Blood Pressure Normal Less than 120 and Less than 80 High Blood Pressure (no other heart risk factors) 140 or higher or 90 or higher High Blood Pressure (with other heart risk factors, according to some providers) 130 or higher or 80 or higher Dangerously high blood pressure - seek medical care right away 180 or higher and 120 or higher

If you've been diagnosed with high blood pressure, your provider may recommend lifestyle changes and/or medicines to control your blood pressure. Your provider may also recommend that you regularly check your blood pressure at home with an automated blood pressure monitor. An at-home blood pressure monitor usually includes a blood pressure cuff and a digital device to record and display blood pressure readings.

Home monitoring is not a replacement for regular visits to your provider. But it can provide important information, such as whether treatment is working or your condition may have worsened. Also, home monitoring may make the test less stressful. Many people get nervous about getting their blood pressure taken at a provider's office. This is called ""white coat syndrome."" It can cause a temporary rise in blood pressure, making the results less accurate. For more information about home monitoring of blood pressure, talk to your provider.

If you were tested for low blood pressure, a blood pressure reading of 90 systolic, 60 diastolic (90/60) or lower is considered abnormal. Treatments for low blood pressure may include medicines and making certain changes to your diet.",medlineplus.gov
